# Introduction

The Pacific Salmon Strategy Initiative (PSSI) was a generational investment of over \$500 million towards habitat restoration, hatchery enhancement, fisheries management, scientific research, and other activities related to Pacific Salmon. The multi-faceted initiative sought to restore vulnerable populations of Pacific salmon and their habitat, support sustainable fishing opportunities while reducing impacts on vulnerable stocks, and build capacity among partners to achieve better outcomes for Pacific salmon ([DFO 2025](https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/campaign-campagne/pss-ssp/index-eng.html)). Supporting these aims were investments in scientific research focused on improving our understanding of salmon and their ecosystems to inform effective decision-making and rebuilding.

Beginning in 2022, new research programs and capacity were established within the Pacific Region Science branch as part of the PSSI. Following a DFO workshop that identified priority research areas [@lagasse2024], multi-year research projects were developed in support of two Science-led PSSI sub-initiatives: Improved Understanding of Salmon Ecosystems, and Science to Support Hatchery Modernization. Projects spanned across the four research divisions of the Science branch covering freshwater and marine domains, hatchery and fishery management advice, and simulation modelling to genetic and physiological studies.

Collaborative and inter-disciplinary approaches were an important theme for research programs, recognizing the importance of cooperation among scientists, managers, stakeholders, and Indigenous groups to achieve desired outcomes for Pacific salmon [@lagasse2024; @buxton2021]. Pacific salmon are managed under a complex, multi-jurisdictional framework and are subject to a variety of threats throughout their life-cycle stemming from natural and anthropogenic causes. To accurately assess and understand status and drivers of productivity across the many conservation units of salmon in the Pacific region requires a diverse range of studies and approaches undertaken cooperatively across organizations and informed by management questions and priority information needs. Synthesis and communication of findings is also important to share insights and advice relevant to decision-making.

This report provides an overview of the outcomes and research findings of DFO Science initiatives funded by the PSSI. The purpose of this report is to:

1.  Provide summary reports covering \~49 research projects related to Pacific salmon, their ecosystems, and management decisions.

2.  Synthesize findings within research themes to highlight key insights and advice.

3.  Identify knowledge gaps and priority research questions to support future decision-making and rebuilding of Pacific salmon.
