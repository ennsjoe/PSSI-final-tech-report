## Objectives

The objectives of this report are to:

1. First objective here
2. Second objective here
3. Third objective here

# Methods

## Study Area

Describe where the work was conducted.
```{r study-area-map, fig.cap="Map of the study area."}
# Example: include a pre-made diagram
# knitr::include_graphics("figures/diagrams/study-area-map.png")
```

## Data Collection

Describe how data were collected, including dates, equipment, and protocols.

## Data Analysis

# Results

## Summary Statistics
```{r load-data}
# Example: load your CSV data
# data <- read_csv("data/processed/your-data.csv")

# Placeholder data for demonstration
data <- data.frame(
  site = c("Site A", "Site B", "Site C"),
  mean_value = c(23.4, 31.2, 28.7),
  sd_value = c(4.2, 5.1, 3.8)
)
```
```{r summary-table}
kable(data, 
      col.names = c("Site", "Mean", "SD"),
      caption = "Summary statistics by site.",
      digits = 1)
```

## Main Findings

Present your key results here. Reference figures and tables as needed.
```{r results-figure, fig.cap="Comparison of mean values across study sites."}
ggplot(data, aes(x = site, y = mean_value)) +
  geom_col(fill = "steelblue") +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean_value - sd_value, 
                    ymax = mean_value + sd_value),
                width = 0.2) +
  labs(x = "Site", y = "Mean Value") +
  theme_minimal()
```
