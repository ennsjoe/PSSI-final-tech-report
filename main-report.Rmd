# Executive Summary

Brief overview of the report's key findings and recommendations.

# Introduction

## Background

-   Overview of PSSI with a specific focus on funding programs and objectives for DFO Science branch

    -   overarching objectives of PSSI and importance of research to support rebuilding of Pacific salmon

    -   myriad stressors on Pacific salmon and various responses across the Pacific region

    -   Importance of evidence-based decision-making to recover and manage salmon

-   Timelines and process for selection of research projects, conducting field work and analysis, reporting

    -   Initial workshop held in 2022

    -   research progress and objectives summarized in Science bulletin

## Purpose

Describe the scope and purpose of the report.

1.  Provide an overview of outcomes and research findings from projects led by DFO Science as part of the PSSI
2.  Synthesize findings across research and management themes to better understand stressors on Pacific salmon, how populations are responding, and potential management interventions
3.  Identify knowledge gaps and priority work areas to support future decision-making and rebuilding of Pacific salmon

# Research Areas

Describe the studies, extent, and characteristics of research and monitoring conducted as part of PSSI.

Present conceptual diagram and research categories showing linkages between research areas, salmon ecology, and management decisions
