## Pacific Salmon Strategy Initiative Overview

The Pacific Salmon Strategy Initiative (PSSI) was a generational investment of over \$500 million in habitat restoration, hatchery enhancement, fisheries management, scientific research, and other activities related to Pacific salmon. Over its five year span beginning in 2021, the multi-faceted initiative sought to restore vulnerable populations of Pacific salmon and their habitats, support sustainable fishing opportunities while reducing impacts on at‑risk stocks, and build capacity among partners to achieve better outcomes for Pacific salmon. In doing so, the initiative sought to respond to long‑standing concerns about declines in many salmon populations, increasing pressures from climate change, and the need for more integrated approaches to management and recovery.

PSSI brought significant new capacity and resources to Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO), the lead federal agency for the initiative, enabling expanded scientific research, enhanced stewardship and restoration activities, additional capacity for enhancement and monitoring, and new collaborative approaches with Indigenous and non-Indigenous partners. The initiative was initially designed and managed across four pillars—Conservation and Stewardship, Salmon Enhancement, Harvest Transformation, and Integration and Collaboration—each of which involved multiple sectors within DFO and included several initiatives (Table 1). The pillars were intended to provide a framework for aligning actions across habitat, hatcheries, fisheries, and governance in support of the long‑term persistence and resilience of Pacific salmon.

The conservation and stewardship pillar focused on new activities and investments supporting the long-term persistence and rebuilding of Pacific salmon populations. Key components included a doubling of the British Columbia Salmon Restoration and Innovation Fund (BCSRIF), investing in research to improve our understanding of salmon and their ecosystems, advancing integrated planning for salmon ecosystems to mitigate pressures on freshwater habitats, developing integrated rebuilding plans for vulnerable salmon populations, improving supports for salmon stewardship activities through engagement, and capacity-building with First Nations and community partners.

The salmon enhancement pillar aimed to modernize hatchery programs to more effectively support the conservation, recovery, and sustainable use of Pacific salmon. A key objective under this pillar was to invest in new hatchery infrastructure and capacity, including retrofitting existing facilities and building new facilities in the Upper Fraser area. The pillar also aimed to strengthen collaboration and enhancement partnerships, including with First Nations and other stakeholders, while investing in hatchery science related to genetics, fish health, salmon ecosystems, and operational monitoring. In addition, this pillar supported development of a modernized enhancement policy intended to guide decision-making in a way that better supports the overall enhancement vision, including the targeted use of conservation-based hatchery production to help recover, stabilize, and restore vulnerable salmon stocks.

The harvest transformation pillar was intended to change how Pacific salmon fisheries were managed in response to long-term stock declines and ongoing conservation concerns. Its key objectives included adopting more precautionary and selective fishing approaches, including exploring mark-selective fisheries, and developing new tools to better manage harvest capacity across sectors. The pillar also included commitments to update the Salmon Allocation Policy and to update licensing, regulatory, and management frameworks, including measures such as licence buyback programs and long-term commercial fishery closures in areas with significant conservation concerns. In addition, it aimed to improve the timeliness and accuracy of fishery monitoring and catch reporting programs to strengthen the information base used for harvest decision-making.

The integration and collaboration pillar focused on strengthening collective capacity to address Pacific salmon declines by improving how DFO worked both internally and with external partners. Key objectives under this pillar were to provide capacity support to various internal and external groups involved in salmon conservation and management, to improve collaboration among federal, provincial, territorial, Indigenous, and other governments, and to prioritize salmon stocks for recovery through coordinated, cross-jurisdictional planning and decision-making processes.

## Scientific Research Components of PSSI

The PSSI pillars were underpinned by a dual-track investment in scientific research, combining internal DFO expertise with external grants and partnerships. This new scientific capacity supported a diverse range of projects intended to inform rebuilding plans, identify factors driving population declines, better understand the impacts of climate change, and pilot new approaches for monitoring, enhancement, fisheries harvest, and restoration. By supporting research within DFO and externally, the initiative aimed to leverage and build on existing capacity within the federal government and across academic institutions, Indigenous organizations, non-governmental organizations, and industry.

While the first phase of BCSRIF was already underway with over X projects, PSSI significantly expanded this reach by funding a second phase. This resulted in 72 new collaborative agreements (Appendix \@ref(app:BCSRIF)), with many focused on scientific research in areas such as climate change modelling, habitat restoration effectiveness, and monitoring innovation. These investments enabled First Nations, academic researchers, industry, and community organizations to work alongside DFO scientists, strengthening the evidence base for management decisions while incorporating Indigenous knowledge, local observations, and novel technologies into the broader PSSI research portfolio.

Within DFO Science, PSSI resources were primarily concentrated into two initiatives: Improved Understanding of Salmon Ecosystems and Science to Support Hatchery Modernization. Targeted funding also bolstered research in support of the Habitat Restoration Centre of Expertise, improving the management and accessibility of salmon-related data, increasing the capacity of the molecular genetics lab, and expanding monitoring of recreational fisheries. This work was implemented across the Pacific Region’s four Science divisions—Stock Assessment, Ecosystem Science, Ocean Science, and Aquatic Diagnostics—enabling multi-disciplinary approaches to research and monitoring.

The largest PSSI initiative led by DFO Science was Improved Understanding of Salmon Ecosystems. The overarching aim of this initiative was to enable the development of effective conservation strategies and management actions for wild salmon and their ecosystems by developing a comprehensive understanding of habitat, ecosystem, and climate change impacts on salmon productivity. Research planning and prioritization began in 2022 with a DFO workshop that identified knowledge gaps and research themes [@lagasse2024]. Subsequently, research proposals underwent a peer-review process and steering committee evaluation. Beginning in 2023, dozens of multi-year projects were funded, including the establishment of new research programs and the expansion or continuation of existing long-term programs.

The second major DFO Science initiative, Science to Support Hatchery Modernization, was a part of the PSSI Salmon Enhancement pillar. This initiative was designed to provide scientific advice and information to inform planning and program implementation, advance the use of molecular genetics and other tools for assessment, and expand fishery and escapement sampling programs. These research activities were intended to support the expansion of hatchery programs under PSSI, informing effective enhancement for population rebuilding and providing harvest opportunities while reducing risks for wild salmon populations. Research priorities were co-developed by a steering committee representing the Salmonid Enhancement Program and DFO Science.

In this report, we summarize the outcomes and findings of research projects funded through the PSSI, with a focus on work led by DFO Science in the Pacific Region. We synthesize results across several research themes aligned with the major PSSI initiatives(Figure 1), providing an overview of findings from a diverse set of multi-disciplinary projects. For the Improved Understanding of Salmon Ecosystems initiative, we review research within five thematic areas: salmon population monitoring, life-cycle approaches, freshwater ecosystems, marine ecosystems, and climate change vulnerability. For the Science to Support Hatchery Modernization sub-initiative, we outline research conducted under the Genetics, Fish Health, and Hatchery Practices themes. In addition, we describe broader research and monitoring activities supported by PSSI, including work related to fisheries monitoring and new harvest techniques, stock assessment advice, and new tools for data mobilization and management. We provide project summaries for `n_projects` DFO-led research projects, offering a snapshot of the current state of Pacific salmon science under PSSI. Although the synthesis is not comprehensive of all research conducted under PSSI, it highlights the insights, knowledge gaps and future priorities identified during the five years of the initiative as they relate to thematic areas.
