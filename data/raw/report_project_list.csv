Habitat issues in these watersheds are linked to excess sediment delivery resulting from forest harvesting activities and associated road-building.  This has resulted in the infilling of holding pools and estuarine tidal channels and in some cases cutting off upstream connections to freshwater.  This issue was particularly devasting in the fall of 2022 when stage 5 drought occurred during the month of October indicating an urgent need to restore this habitat.  The project aims to address the issues of channel connectivity, availability of low salt marsh habitats and loss of holding pools by:  improving salmon access to existing spawning and nursery habitats, rehabilitating damaged estuarine nursery habitats and restoring cool water holding pools for migrating salmon.

A significant component is to develop a better understanding of the impact of current and future climate conditions for the North Pacific socio-ecological system. 

Two-year funding is requested from BCSRIF to ensure the effective development of the project and commence work on early deliverables related to the necessary downscaled basin-wide models, data governance and engineering for the modelling and visualization, indigenous participation in the design of the project, and ensure that there is effective and efficient coordination of the project. Salmon will be an exemplar species while a modular approach will allow for the work to include / be applied to other species of interest.

BCSRIF funding will be used to advance Canadian interests and develop an innovative approach to ocean forecasting that allows for enhanced down-scaled modelling of the boundary conditions (open ocean) for use in higher resolution coastal models that are in use or being developed. The goal is to inform fisheries production predictions that more fully account for the ongoing and increasing implications of climate change.  

Partners in Canada that have expressed an interest in BECI include the government agencies DFO and ECCC, Canadian fishing industry (CanFisCO and BC Seafood Alliance), First Nations (e.g., FNFC) and academic scientists. 

The BCSRIF investment would leverage comparable (if not more significant investments) from the Unites States and Japan.

While abundant salmon populations once provided annual sustenance to the Wet’suwet’en people, such abundance and diversity has largely eroded over the last several decades to the point of no longer fulfilling our community’s needs. There is an urgent need to restore our lands and waters that have been degraded due to logging, road building, agriculture, highway, railway, and urban development, and to rebuild our salmon populations to a level of abundance that can sustain our annual food needs and provide for the surrounding biological community. We will accomplish this through a multi-pronged approach that partners with academics, local environmental organizations, First Nation, government, and watershed groups to undertake activities recently deemed of high priority. Broadly, these include: engaging with local land users to stabilize streambanks and rebuild riparian structure in the most degraded habitats, develop robust rebuilding plans for culturally important and highly diminished species and populations, and improve monitoring data for such populations to assess effectiveness of ongoing habitat restoration and rebuilding efforts.","A Rocha

TDC may already be a factor in BC Chinook declines, and is expected to be a burgeoning issue under climate change. Thiamine is derived from prey in the marine environment and levels in predators vary in response to changing ocean conditions and diet. This project will provide baseline knowledge of the status of thiamine in BC Chinook salmon by: 1) determining thiamine levels in eggs and river entry fish from populations representative of life history types; 2) establishing the thiamine attributes of Chinook prey species; and 3) evaluating links between thiamine status of Chinook and mechanisms of TDC. This project will identify populations experiencing or at risk of TDC, guide realistic mitigation strategies in hatcheries, and inform prediction of future change.","Bon Chovy Fishing Charters
