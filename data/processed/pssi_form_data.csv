Of these, 14 pooled gill and 26 pooled liver samples from 60 fish caught at 3 locations (Village Reef, Nanat Islet, and Sarita Bay) from June to September 2024 were analyzed for harmful algal biotoxins based upon when and where biotoxins were measured in the surrounding sea water.

These generated 117 filter and 117 filtrate samples, all of which were analyzed for biotoxins. They also generated a total of 69 pooled gill and 66 pooled liver samples, of which 24 gill and 33 liver samples were analyzed for harmful algal biotoxins and the results compared with those for sea water.","N/A","to assess the risk posed by harmful algal biotoxins to juvenile WCVI Chinook in their critical habitat.juvenile WCVI Chinook salmon are exposed to and take up harmful algal biotoxins in Barkley Sound. biotoxins known to harm fish peak in summer/fall in Barkley Sound in both water and fish tissues.results suggest that biotoxin exposure/impacts can be mitigated e.g. via timing of hatchery releases.","Biotoxins produced by harmful algae are know to cause illness and mortality in marine animals including juvenile fish (Lefebvre et al., 2005). Regular monitoring of harmful algal biotoxins in B.C. coastal waters since 2020 (Ross et al., 2025b) has revealed significant correlations between climate variables (e.g. water temperature) and the concentrations of these toxins in areas known to be frequented by Pacific salmon. These include at-risk WCVI Chinook salmon populations, for which harmful algae were identified as an emerging threat during the WCVI Chinook Rebuilding Plan Marine Risk Assessment (MRA) Workshop #3 held in April 2022. However, the levels of harmful algal biotoxins to which juvenile WCVI Chinook salmon are exposed in critical habitats such as Barkley and Clayoquot Sounds are unknown. This is an important knowledge gap, given that low early marine survival is contributing to declines in WCVI Chinook and other Pacific salmon populations. The goal of this PSSI ‘Follow the Fish’ project was to build upon our Biotoxin Monitoring Program (Ross and Mueller, 2024) by adapting established analytical methods and procedures to measure harmful algal biotoxins in juvenile WCVI Chinook salmon tissues (gill, liver) and habitat (Barkley Sound) using samples collected by ‘Follow the Fish’ krill and salmon survey teams, in partnership with local First Nations. This information is being combined with environmental data (water properties, eDNA), assessments of fish health and condition (biometrics, gene expression), and information on life history (otolith microchemistry) to help forecast and potentially mitigate early marine exposure of WCVI Chinook salmon to harmful algal biotoxins, and associated impacts on their health and survival.","Harmful algal biotoxins were measured in sea water using the method developed for our Marine Biotoxin Monitoring Program (Ross and Mueller, 2024). Surface sea water was collected at 5 locations in Barkley Sound (Fig. 1) during krill surveys carried out at the beginning of each month and filtered on board to obtain filter and filtrate samples, from which biotoxins were extracted and analyzed by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry to obtain dissolved and particulate biotoxin concentrations (Ross et al., 2025a). These were combined to obtain monthly values of total biotoxin concentration at each location (Fig. 2). To assess exposure to harmful algal biotoxins, juvenile WCVI Chinook salmon captured by purse seining close to krill survey locations were dissected to obtain gill and liver tissue samples, which were pooled as necessary to obtain sufficient material for analysis. Products and tools developed during this project include a Regional Biotoxin Database (in progress) for organizing, storing and retrieving biotoxin and related environmental, biological, and taxonomic information for sea water and biological samples collected during this project (and the Marine Biotoxin Monitoring Program) with the goal of making it available to co-workers via DMApps. Advances in methodology during this project include procedures to minimize cross-contamination while dissecting and pooling of tissues for biotoxin analysis, and adaptation of the method for sea water analysis to measure harmful algal biotoxins in very small amounts of tissue, thereby allowing them to be studied in individual fish, organs and/or early life stages (Mueller et al., in preparation). Examples of communication and knowledge transfer include a Newsletter (Ross and Loseto, 2025) that describes the monitoring of biotoxins and contaminants during the PSSI ‘Follow the Fish’ project. Results from the monitoring of biotoxins in Barkley Sound during fall 2023 were also included in a report prepared for Snuneymuxw First Nation (Ross, 2024) on the measurement of harmful algal biotoxins near Nanaimo at the same time, to provide context for the interpretation of those results. Knowledge about seasonal trends in biotoxin concentration obtained during this project, and how it can be used to mitigate risks associated with biotoxin exposure in juvenile salmon through the timing of hatchery releases, was presented during a Fish Health & Hatchery Biology Seminar (Ross, 2025). Key results include:detection and identification of seasonal patterns in the concentrations of harmful algal biotoxins in Barkley Sound, including those know to be harmful to juvenile fish (Fig. 2).detection of certain biotoxins in the tissues of juvenile WCVI Chinook salmon present in Barkley Sound when those biotoxins are relatively abundant in the surrounding water (June to September).recognition that WCVI Chinook are being exposed to harmful algal biotoxins in their critical habitat during early marine life stages,","This project has revealed that juvenile WCVI Chinook salmon present in Barkley Sound during late summer are exposed to harmful algal biotoxins at levels sufficient to cause uptake in their tissues. biotoxins present in Barkley Sound follow seasonal trends similar to those observed elsewhere in B.C. coastal waters (Fig. 2).juvenile WCVI Chinook salmon in Barkley Sound are exposed to increasing levels of algal biotoxins from May onwards, particularly at central and outer locations (Coaster, Swale, Mackenzie: Fig. 1).exposure of juvenile WCVI Chinook salmon to biotoxins is confirmed by detection of domoic acid, yessotoxin, and the paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxin saxitoxin in gill and/or liver tissue from purse seined fish caught in Barkley Sound in late summer 2023 and/or 2024.levels of biotoxins detected in tissues seem to correlate with those in the surrounding water (Fig. 3).Results from our Marine Biotoxin Monitoring Program suggest that certain biotoxins including those harmful to juvenile fish are trending upwards in B.C. coastal waters, and that higher biotoxin levels may be associated with climate-related factors such as increasing temperature and/or nutrient limitation due to stratification caused by higher temperatures or freshwater inputs (Ross at al., 2025). Tools are being developed (CSRF project 2025-26-11-07) to predict future levels of biotoxin exposure and uptake based upon linkages with environmental conditions measured at the same time. This will allow DFO to forecast and potentially mitigate levels and impacts of biotoxin exposure in WCVI Chinook; for example, by timing the release of hatchery fish to minimize exposure (Ross, 2025). Meanwhile, gene expression analysis is being carried out (Art Bass et al.) to see whether observed levels of biotoxin exposure result in stress responses, biological effects and/or health impacts in juvenile salmon, thereby helping to identify biologically significant thresholds of exposure for these limiting factors.We are working with the Contaminants group (Lisa Loseto et al.) to investigate the separate and cumulative effects of biotoxins and contaminants on juvenile WCVI Chinook salmon, taking advantage of the observed seasonal trends in biotoxin exposure.We are also working with the Otolith Microchemistry group (Nicole LaForge, Micah Quindazzi) to relate biotoxin exposure and impacts to life stage and history (e.g. estuary residence time, age at entry) for specific populations (Sarita, Robertson), and with the eDNA group (Christoph Deeg et al.) on interactions of juvenile WCVI Chinook salmon with harmful algae and other marine species.In addition to providing total biotoxin concentrations, the analysis of filter and filtrate samples (Ross et al., 2025a) allows us to compare biotoxin levels in different salmon tissues with dissolved and particulate biotoxin concentrations in the surrounding water, and to see if the data support a particular pathway of exposure (e.g. uptake via ingestion","Remaining knowledge gaps include additional monitoring data with which to establish longer-term trends in biotoxin production in Barkley Sound and how these may relate to climate change. They also include future data on adult returns and indicators of health, recruitment, etc. for salmon that were exposed to the observed concentrations of biotoxins in Barkley Sound during this project (i.e. from July 2023 to November 2025). This will allow long-term risks associated with ‘carry forward’ impacts of biotoxin exposure to be assessed, along with any early marine life stage impacts revealed by gene expression analysis and/or biometric indicators of fish health in juvenile salmon during this project. Meanwhile, the findings of this project can be operationalized by incorporating information on the temporal and spatial distributions of harmful algal biotoxins in Barkley Sound (Figs. 1 and 2) into the scheduling of hatchery releases for different populations (Sarita, Robertston) based on knowledge of their migration behaviour (incl. salt water entry and estuarine residence times) to minimize biotoxin exposure and impacts in juvenile salmon. The observed relationships between biotoxin levels in fish tissues and dissolved, particulate and/or total biotoxin concentrations (Fig. 3) in the surrounding water can also be used to help identify pathways of exposure and evaluate current and future risks posed by measured and projected biotoxin concentrations to juvenile WCVI salmon in Barkley Sound."

Modern tools and approaches for tracking and assessing these threats are needed to support responsive and integrated regulatory, planning, partnership, and monitoring activities to help safeguard fish and fish habitat.We developed geospatial estimates of individual and cumulative threats to salmon and Species At Risk habitat in the Fraser River Basin from human activities, landscape disturbance, and climate change (e.g. pollutant loading, sedimentation, flow alteration, high stream temperatures). We modelled and mapped 13 threats for the full stream network and identified where and for which species threats were higher. We further applied the threat scores and indicators of important habitat for salmon in the Thompson-Nicola to help inform restoration planning for salmon ecosystems.This project is the first to provide spatially extensive estimates of freshwater threats to salmon and inform how restoration and management actions can potentially improve population outcomes. The estimated threats are now used in salmon population life-cycle modelling to evaluate the impact on salmon across their freshwater life cycle.","Understanding where and how fish and fish habitat are impacted by human activities and climate change is critical information for targeting effective conservation and management actions to help preserve populations. Geospatial cumulative effects assessments offer a powerful approach for evaluating simultaneous threats across large spatial scales, improving upon traditional field-based assessments (Halpern et al. 2008a; Halpern and Fujita 2013). However, many existing assessments rely on simple proxies of human activity (e.g., road density) rather than mechanistic metrics that directly link stressors to ecological responses relevant to fish and fish habitat (e.g., sediment loading or flow alteration) to provide more meaningful applications (e.g., stressor-response curves; Rosenfeld et al. 2022). To address this gap, this project advanced existing geospatial tools, indicators, and threat metrics for the Pacific Region (DFO 2022) by incorporating a mechanistic approach to better quantify anthropogenic and climate change impacts and inform management actions for salmon and Species at Risk (SAR) in the Fraser River Basin (FRB).The Thompson-Shuswap and Nicola River watersheds were identified as pilot areas to deliver Integrated Planning for Salmon Ecosystems (IPSE) under the Pacific Salmon Strategy Initiative (PSSI). Within the scope of this project, we conducted a case-study on the Thompson-Nicola Ecological Drainage Unit (EDU) by developing examples of how individual and cumulative threat scores can be applied to help inform restoration prioritization and management actions. The Thompson-Nicola spatial analysis was used to inform IPSE collaborative planning processes in the Thompson-Nicola watersheds.","We developed a geospatial tool to summarize anthropogenic and climate change related cumulative threats to freshwater species and habitats using open-source input data and software that can be reproduced for different time periods and freshwater species and their habitats. All threats were estimated for each stream reach within the BC Freshwater Atlas (FWA). We derived nine individual human-activity and landscape disturbance threats: aquatic invasive species, riparian disturbance, in-stream habitat destruction, flow alteration, latitudinal fragmentation, sedimentation, pollutant loading, and nutrient loading. The input data was processed and combined to produce an individual threat score that characterizes the mechanism of disturbance to freshwater species for each score. For climate change threats, we compiled model outputs of projected stream flow and temperature to estimate threats of flood-risk, low and high stream flow, and high summer stream temperature from 2040-2060 under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. The individual threat scores were standardized across the study area, weighted equally, and added together to calculate a human activity and landscape disturbance cumulative threat score and a climate change based cumulative threat score (see Iacarella et al. 2025 for detailed methods). Finally, both cumulative threat scores were paired with salmon and SAR distributions (i.e., CU boundaries and delineated stream habitats, respectively) and evaluated to identify where threats were greatest and which species and CUs were exposed to the highest threat levels.For the Thompson-Nicola EDU case study, we focused on human activity threats that may reasonably be mitigated, including riparian disturbance, water withdrawal, and longitudinal fragmentation from dams. We identified overlap between these threats and two approaches used to identify areas important to salmon: (1) CU delineations and (2) modelled environmentally favourable spawning habitats. The modelled environmentally favourability predictions were derived from large-scale environmental niche models to predict shifts in habitat favourability from current to future climate conditions (Iacarella and Weller 2023). We multiplicatively combined threat scores with environmental favourability for salmon spawning to create composite scores that reflect a gradient of potential management implications (see Fig. 20 in Iacarella et al. 2025). A high threat score combined with a high favourable habitat probability identifies an area that warrants localized investigation and potential restoration or mitigation actions. Conversely, a low threat score combined with a low favourable habitat probability identifies an area that is less likely to need management attention based on salmon values (i.e., predicted spawning habitat) and low level of anthropogenic impact. Our results indicated the highest cumulative threat scores around the lower Fraser River and within the inter","This project is the first to provide spatially extensive estimates of human activity and climate change threats that are directly linked to salmon, SAR, and their habitats at the stream reach scale. The approaches used to estimate each of the indicators provide an initial broad-scale standardized framework that can be applied to characterize threats throughout the Pacific Region. Within the FRB, we observed the highest threats in the Lower Fraser and interior plateau, and specifically, within the Nicola River, Guichon Creek, and San Jose River. Overall, roads were the greatest contributor to human activity-based threats, disturbing in-stream habitats, riparian areas, and contributing to sediment and nutrient loading. These results improve our understanding of the spatial distribution and relative magnitude of threats across the FRB, providing a foundation for predicting population-level impacts from cumulative effects and life-cycle modelling. A major source of uncertainty is the spatial accuracy of the BC Freshwater Atlas. Known issues to the FWA include overestimates of headwater streams in interior regions, misaligned stream delineations and large river catchment areas. Each of the individual threat scores have their own uncertainties and limitations, as detailed in Table 2 of Iacarella et al. (2025). In general, the input data are subject to limitations arising from potentially misclassified land cover or land use, features included in datasets but not present on the landscape, and unmapped activities or features, which introduce uncertainty into individual threat scores and the cumulative score. An additional source of uncertainty is the unresolved habitat use and distribution of salmon and SAR within the FRB. The approach used to combine individual threats into a cumulative threat score (e.g., addition, multiplication, etc.) is another source of uncertainty that can be evaluated in future work by modelling population responses to individual and cumulative threats.","Although our threat estimates represent the mechanisms by which salmon and freshwater SAR are affected, the magnitude at which these threats influence salmon population dynamics remains unknown. To address this gap, we are continuing to refine existing threat estimates and developing new threats that are explicitly linked to stressor-response functions for cumulative effects and life-cycle modelling. For example, we have developed additional riparian disturbance metrics that better capture the impacts to riparian function (e.g., large-woody debris recruitment, disturbance to stream-shading, riparian filtering), which were not included in the original report. Moreover, we are developing a stage-structured population model for Interior Fraser Coho (IFC) to estimate how stressors (estimated threats) are influencing the population across their freshwater life stages. For this work, we are utilising the Cumulative Effects Model for Prioritizing Recovery Actions (CEMPRA), which applies stressor-response functions to account for the impact of stressors on vital rates and the overall population overtime and under different climate change and mitigation scenarios (Bayly et al. 2024). Additional next steps for this work include expanding the cumulative threats model to other watersheds in the Pacific Region. To date, the model has also been applied to the Upper Bulkley Watershed to aid in salmon habitat restoration planning. Validation is an important step of most modelling exercises, though is often not a standard component of cumulative effect assessments (Halpern and Fujita 2013). Validating these threats through field verification and in situ data would be beneficial for threats that involve applied relationships and estimations, such as the flow accumulated loadings (i.e., nutrients, pollution, sedimentation). Future work could re-run the model at regular intervals to evaluate change in threats over time. Finally, additional analyses could quantify uncertainty in modelled threats and evaluate underlying assumptions through sensitivity tests."

Presented to SEP Planning and Assessment Unit, 13 Jan 2026.","NA","NA","NA","Understanding the performance of management actions prior to implementation is increasingly critical for Pacific salmon given accountabilities under the modernized Fisheries Act and growing risks associated with environmental and biological variability and change, yet tools to evaluate harvest, hatchery and habitat levers have not been available.We developed an open-source, decision-support tool, salmonMSE, to prioritize management actions related to harvest regulation, hatchery enhancement and habitat restoration to achieve objectives across sectors. This tool expands on those previously used by explicitly accounting for dynamics of hatchery-origin and natural-origin fish, modelling mark-selective fisheries, considering risk and uncertainty, and including biological realism with the ability to model a diversity of life-history strategies.","Pacific salmon are exposed to numerous interacting stressors, including climate change, fishing, and land-use changes related to e.g., urban development, forestry, mining, and agriculture (Tulloch et al. 2022). Management of salmon is multifaceted to address these stressors: including harvest regulation, hatchery enhancement and habitat restoration. Management decisions increasingly require transparency and risk-based approaches to respond to uncertainties. For example, the Fisheries Act requires the development of rebuilding plans for stocks that fall below limit reference points (considered in a ‘critical’ status zone). There is an emerging need to evaluate performance of candidate management actions for rebuilding plans prior to implementation, and the DFO’s precautionary approach framework requires uncertainty and risk to be taken into account when developing and implementing decision rules.Similarly, under the Species at Risk Act, there is a need to evaluate recovery potential of populations at risk of extinction under various management scenarios. However, we lack accessible, broadly applicable quantitative tools to evaluate management options across management levers. Through this project we developed an open-source, decision-support tool for Pacific salmon, salmonMSE, to inform science advice for Integrated Management Plans, Rebuilding Plans under the Fisheries Act, Salmon Enhancement Plans, and the SARA listing process. This tool can address questions like: What level of hatchery enhancement and harvest regulation are required to achieve rebuilding targets? What is the maximum hatchery production possible while maintaining ‘wild’ population status, as defined by proportionate natural influence, PNI goals by Wither et al. (2018)? How should mass-marking strategies and mark-selective fisheries be designed in order to achieve harvest and PNI goals while allowing for conservation of wild populations?Within hatcheries, which harvest release strategies and broodtake rules best meet conservation and PNI objectives?Where relationships between environmental drivers or limiting factors and survival rates have been identified, what are the benefits of habitat restoration to mitigate impacts of those factors on conservation and harvest objectives, relative to other management levers? In partnership with Huu-ay-aht First Nation, DFO Salmon Enhancement Program and DFO Science, we applied salmonMSE to Sarita River Chinook, on the west coast of Vancouver Island as a case study, to evaluate the impacts of mark-selective fisheries and hatchery scenarios on the ability to achieve a range of conservation, harvest and hatchery objectives, and to inform rebuilding plans.","SalmonMSE is a decision-support tool developed for Pacific salmon founded on ‘management strategy evaluation’, MSE, which is an approach for evaluating the relative effectiveness of management actions using computer simulations that represent various possible realities of the fishery and the biological systems (Punt et al. 2016; openMSE 2023). To account for uncertainties, these simulations are repeated over numerous possible realities to produce a distribution of outcomes for each management action.We developed a stage-based life-cycle model, capturing population processes relevant to Pacific salmon acting in freshwater and marine environments, and the impacts of harvest and environmental conditions on juvenile and adult stages. The underlying model structure is modular and flexible allowing for reduced complexity to simpler model forms when data are limited and increased complexity to address emerging threats when data are available. We included the ability to model an integrated hatchery population, whereby the hatchery and natural spawning components of a population are modelled separately but interact on the spawning grounds.SalmonMSE provides advances relative to previously available tools that either did not consider risk and uncertainty or did not consider hatchery dynamics explicitly and therefore could not evaluate performance on hatchery objectives related to maintaining wildness of integrated hatchery populations, i.e., high PNI values (Withler et al. 2018). By explicitly modelling hatchery impacts on populations, salmonMSE can evaluate performance on conservation, production and ‘wildness’ objectives. Our application to a case study on Sarita River Chinook salmon highlights the potential for trade-offs among objectives, suggesting that in some cases it may not be possible to achieve both wildness and high abundances simultaneously. Our case study further highlights that habitat restoration may be needed to support production objectives when survival in freshwater is limiting. An illustrative example is provided in Box 1. This tool fills a critical cap in DFO’s ability to strategically evaluate decisions on all three management levers. The salmonMSE tool is generic and can be applied across Pacific salmon species and populations. salmonMSE can be adapted to data availability, relying on coarse resolution survival rates (e.g., freshwater vs. marine) and meta-analyses, neighbouring populations, and expert opinion for parameterization when data are limited, and providing population-specific finer life-stage resolution and evaluating management actions targeting specific life stages where data are available. An open-source R package (salmonMSE) was developed to facilitate access of the tool, with three underlying repositories providing code for the R package and an application to one case study on the west coast Vancouver Island, Sarita River Chinook, and second on-going application to Upper Strait of Georgia Chinook to support the develo","This tool can inform management decisions and address trade-offs between conservation, harvest, and ‘wildness’ objectives within rebuilding plans under Fisheries Act, Fisheries Science Advisory Reports, SEP production plans, and SARA listing decisions. Furthermore, the modernized Fisheries Act requires that management consider the biology of the fish and environmental conditions affecting the stock, and this tool is designed to account for biological characteristics like life-history diversity (e.g., accounting for differences in survival rates among life-history groups within a population) and environmental drivers of survival at various life stages, where data are available. In answering these questions, this tool can inform both strategic decisions about choices among management lever(s), and operational decisions about harvest control rules, hatchery release strategies and habitat restoration.Uncertainties are explicitly considered in salmonMSE in two ways. First, distributions are included in parameterization and projections are run over a large number of random Monte Carlo trials to account for parameter uncertainties and to provide probabilistic outcomes (e.g., the probability of achieving management objectives). In this way, the outcomes of management evaluations are less certain and probabilities of achieving objectives more diffuse when underlying parameters are more uncertain. In addition, uncertainties in model structure and parameters can be explicitly considered by running sensitivity analyses over a range of plausible hypotheses. These analyses can help to identify those parameters with the highest impact on the relative performance of management strategies, requiring further monitoring or research to reduce uncertainties.","A training session for technical analysts within DFO, First Nations and partner organizations will be hosted April 2026 to support implementation of salmonMSE. The intended outcomes for the workshop are for participants to understand the scope and capabilities of salmonMSE, have working knowledge of how to apply salmonMSE to simple examples that include integrated hatcheries, and understand how these can be expanded to include complexities in life-history diversity, environmental drivers, and harvest and hatchery management strategies.SalmonMSE is currently being applied to Upper Strait of Georgia Chinook salmon to inform the evaluation of harvest and hatchery management options for an upcoming FSAR process (planned for Nov 2026). We recommend the application of salmonMSE to inform fisheries stock advice for Pacific salmon more broadly, especially when harvest and hatchery levers are considered and conservation, harvest, and PNI objectives are identified. We further recommend exploring salmonMSE for SEP production planning, e.g., for evaluating alternative release strategies and broodtake rules.Gaps remain in our ability to include environmental drivers and impacts of habitat restoration into salmonMSE. There are opportunities to combine salmonMSE with inferences from other habitat models or limiting factors frameworks, such as CEMPRA (Cumulative Effects Model for Prioritizing Research Activities) and RAMS (Risk Assessment Methods for Salmon), and causal modelling (e.g., using DSEM, Dynamic Structural Equation Models). Doing so would allow us to more clearly and transparently identify and document risks created by environmental or ecosystem conditions for achieving management objectives, and the relative benefits of more specific restoration efforts to mitigate those impacts."

Fish were released at dusk on 25 May 2024 in two spatially distinct groups to create different migration histories.A network of autonomous acoustic receivers was deployed from Okanagan Falls to Osoyoos Lake (21 May to 8 August 2024).Mobile surveys were completed by boat, kayak, and wading, totaling 42 survey days across Vaseux Lake, Osoyoos Lake, and the river between late May and early August.Juvenile Chinook predation by Smallmouth bassTargeted angling for smallmouth bass was conducted in the Okanagan River, Vaseux Lake, and Osoyoos Lake from 3 May to 7 August 2024.Upon capture, fish were immediately euthanized then measured for total length (mm), weighed on a digital balance scale (g), and sexed by visual inspection of the reproductive organs. The entire digestive tract was removed, injected with 90% ethanol for preservation, and frozen for later laboratory analysis.","n=547 sub-yearling Chinook acoustic tagged and released, followed by monitoring movement and survival during their downstream migration in the Okanagan River and Lake system. n=196 smallmouth bass stomach contents collected, n=73 analyzed with visual taxonomy and n=162 analyzed with DNA metabarcoding.","Not applicable.","The objective of this project was to understand factors influencing the survival of juvenile Chinook Salmon in the Okanagan River and Lake system. We found that survival is low during the downstream migration of sub-yearling Chinook in the spring and early summer. Disturbed rearing habitat, high water temperatures, and predation pressure from smallmouth bass were identified as the main threats to Okanagan Chinook juvenile survival. This new knowledge will help us target recovery efforts for this endangered population.","The Canadian Okanagan Chinook population is currently the only Columbia River basin Chinook population in Canada. Chinook escapements to the Okanagan River have been extremely low (less than 100 spawners annually) and many habitat challenges are preventing the recovery of the population. Okanagan Chinook were assessed as Endangered by COSEWIC in 2017, and the population is under review for listing under the Species at Risk Act. Some knowledge gaps that originated from those assessments were uncertainty around juvenile survival and factors influencing it. To answer this knowledge gap, we partnered with Thompson Rivers University to support two graduate students to study factors influencing the survival of juvenile Chinook Salmon in the Okanagan River and Lake system. The project was also developed and implemented in collaboration with the Okanagan Nation Alliance’s fisheries biologist Elinor McGrath.","Habitat use and survival:Subyearling Chinook (n=547) raised in the kł cp̓əlk̓ stim̓ hatchery were implanted with ATS SS400 injectable acoustic transmitters. They were released in two groups, with group A (n=273) released in the Okanagan River below Vertical Drop Structure (VDS) 17 and above Vaseux Lake, and group B (n=274) released downstream of Vaseux lake below McIntyre Dam. A network of 15 ATS SR3001 autonomous receivers was deployed from Okanagan Falls to Osoyoos Lake between 21 May and 8 August, 2024). Receivers were clustered into 7 detection sites, placed to form acoustic “gates” at lake inlets and outlets, narrows and channel constrictions, and potential rearing/migration corridors. An ATS SR3017 mobile receiver with hydrophone was used to survey shallow side channels, deeper offshore areas beyond stationary coverage, and upstream and downstream of VDS structures. The proportion of fish detected decreased sharply for both release groups as fish migrated downstream, which translated to low survival in both release groups. Tag burden was not deemed a source of direct mortality, but could have increased susceptibility to predation. Smallmouth bass diet and predation:Targeted angling was conducted in the Okanagan River, Vaseux Lake, Osoyoos Lake from May 3 to August 7, 2024. The dominant species captured were smallmouth bass, which comprised 76% of the total catch (n=196), followed by Northern Pikeminnow (16%, n=41) and Yellow Perch (4%, n=11). There was a spatial shift in the distribution of smallmouth bass caught during the study. In May, less than half (45%) of smallmouth bass were caught at Vertical Drop Structures (VDS), but the proportion of smallmouth bass captured at VDS structures increased to 100% and 80% in June and July, respectively. Bass were observed utilizing rocky substrate and rip rap below the VDS structures to ambush prey. Diet content visual analysis was performed on a subsample of 73 of the total 196 smallmouth bass. A total of 162 fish stomach samples were sent for DNA barcode sequencing. Chinook salmon was only detected once in the DNA samples, but direct evidence of bass predation on juvenile Chinook was obtained by recovery of an acoustic tag used in the juvenile migration and habitat use study. DNA metabarcoding identified a diverse assemblage of 146 unique prey taxa. Aquatic insects (Diptera, Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera), invasive fish (smallmouth bass, yellow perch, common carp), and native fish (prickly sculpin, mountain whitefish, sockeye/kokanee, chinook) were the most common prey items in smallmouth bass stomach contents.","The research conducted through this project added greatly to the limited knowledge of juvenile Chinook survival in the Okanagan River and Lake system. The acoustic telemetry study revealed that juvenile Chinook survival is low during their spring outmigration in the Okanagan River. It identified critical freshwater mortality hotspots in Vaseux Lake, in the Okanagan River, and in the northern portion of Osoyoos Lake. This mortality was associated with warm water temperatures and habitat constraints, and provides evidence for supporting habitat restoration strategies to increase juvenile survival. Proposed actions include:Reconnecting side channelsRe-naturalizing riparian zonesAdding deep pools, woody debris, and coverManaging macrophyte growthAdjusting dam operations for cold water inflow protectionAdapting hatchery release strategy (timing and location) to maximize juvenile survivalThe predation study revealed that predation pressure by native and invasive fish species, especially by smallmouth bass, is likely high and contributes to the low survival of juvenile Chinook in the Okanagan River and Lake system. It also identified predation hotspots at Vertical Drop Structure (VDS) sites on the Okanagan River. Proposed actions to mitigate the impacts of smallmouth bass predation include:Reduce predation hotspots at VDS sites with restoration efforts to remove or modify existing structuresTargeted smallmouth bass removal in the Okanagan River and Lake system with electrofishing or angling programsProtect and enhance rearing habitat for juvenile Chinook by supporting the habitat restoration strategies listed above","The findings from this project should be considered in the rebuilding and conservation plan of this endangered conservation unit, as it identified specific and tangible actions that have the potential to increase juvenile Chinook survival, productivity, and abundance of the CU. Remaining knowledge gaps and recommendations for future studies include:Using predator-detecting acoustic tags to determine juvenile mortality from predation and finer-scale movement data to elucidate habitat use throughout the migration corridorEstimating the smallmouth bass population size in the Okanagan River and Lake system to quantify the predation pressure on juvenile Chinook Understanding the role of predation from other native and invasive piscivorous fish and avian predators on juvenile Chinook survival"

Fourier Transform-Near Infrared (FT-NIR) spectroscopy and Otolith Shape Analysis (OSA) have provided acceptable age predictions for Rougheye/Blackspotted (REBS complex), Yelloweye and Pacific Ocean Perch rockfish and have demonstrated excellent results for the REBS complex speciation and Yelloweye stock ID. The steadily increasing demand for age data regularly exceeds program capacity, and with the SCL experiencing reductions in funding and skilled personnel, traditional age estimation has become a bottleneck in providing age data for the management of Pacific salmon. Automation of the age assignment process for salmon and rockfish species will facilitate increased capacity and supplement existing personnel providing key model age data to ensure fisheries are sustainably managed.","The SCL program provides approximately 120,000 quality controlled age-estimates for salmon and groundfish species annually. Age data are inputs in calculating rates of reproductivity, growth and mortality, critical components in stock productivity and are key parameters in stock assessment analyses. Provision of timely age data estimates enables downstream modelling of stocks performance and allow for these information to be available for consultation processes which are pivotal for sustainable fisheries management, conservation strategies and ecological research. The steadily increasing demand for age data regularly exceeds program capacity forcing requests to be aged on a prioritized basis, with the SCL experiencing reductions in funding and skilled personnel, traditional age estimation has become a bottleneck in providing age data for the management of Pacific salmon and groundfish (Malde et al. 2020). Traditional techniques, such as scale and otolith age assignment are labour intensive, time consuming, and prone to inter-reader variability. Improved and accelerated age estimates through the deployment of an AI-driven pipeline of CNN and DML predictive age modeling will augment traditional ageing techniques and transform fish age estimation (Moen et al. 2023; Vabø et al. 2021).A multiple agency effort (DFO, Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission (PSMFC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G) and the Northern Southeast Regional Aquaculture Association (NSRAA)) have developed working models to successfully predict Chum ages with an AI algorithm trained on 15,000 scale images. Although the existing models are coastwide (Alaska, BC and Washington), our research team is currently supplementing BC images to increase the robustness of the coastwide models while developing new models specific to Chum salmon captured in waters local to BC. This is the first step in providing a multi-species Alternative Age Estimation pipeline designed to augment age assignment output capacity within the SCL.","For any AI predictive age model to function it requires input data or attributes, these are typically species and structure dependent. The SCL has focused on the attributes extracted from scales and otoliths for its investigations into predictive age assignment (Table 1).In the case of salmon, specifically Chum the scale growth pattern is the attribute and a scale image is the means of interpretation (LaLanne and Safsten 1969; McNicol and MacLellan 2010). Chum salmon scales were collected by four agencies: NOAA, ADF&G, NSRAA and DFO. All groups prepare scales similarly for age estimation; scales are mounted to a gum card and acetate impressions are made. An automated high-speed Leica Emspira 3 mobile base camera system was used to selectively and rapidly image impressions of DFO Chum scales. CNN models were developed using 15,754 scale images; 24% of the total collection. Data were split into training (70%, n=11,012), validation (15%, n=2,365), and testing (15%, n=2,377) and randomly but stratified by age classes to ensure consistent age class distributions across each set. We deployed an ensemble of three CNN models architectures with a proven track record in their application for image classification and regression problems. The ensemble model of EfficientNetV2L, NASNetLarge, and ConvNeXtLarge provided excellent age predictions for the most common age classes of Chum recruiting to the fishery (Figure 1) (Ames, et al., In press).In the case of groundfish, the otolith is the structure employed and its weight, shape morphometrics and Infrared spectral scan are the attributes. Together, the otolith morphometric attributes (weight, dimensional measurements, and shape outlines) and FT-NIR spectroscopic data (Benson et al. 2023) were used in machine learning algorithms in R to create predictive statistical models for species classification, stock delineation, and the automated age estimation of select rockfish species. Specifically, age estimation models of Rougheye, Yelloweye and Pacific Ocean perch provided estimates that met the lower acceptable precision rates set by quality control parameters for human generated precisions (Figure 2). Previously aged samples from the SCL Structure Library will be sourced, attribute data will be collected and incorporated into current models to increased the robustness of age predictions of these rockfish species. The Alternative Age Estimation program has made great advancements in predictive age modeling based on key attributes of otoliths and scales with plans to apply these models to the most commonly aged species at the SCL.","Traditional age estimation methods rely on highly specialized skills developed through long-term mentorship, these methods are time-intensive and resource-heavy, limiting scalability and throughput. The steadily increasing demand for age data regularly exceeds program capacity forcing requests to be aged on a prioritized basis. While a significant amount of expertise is required to produce fish age estimates this is something AI can be trained to do. This modernization and the work to date establishes the groundwork for an AI-driven pipeline that augments traditional age estimation techniques, dramatically increasing efficiency while maintaining scientific rigor. Accurate and precise age estimation is pivotal for sustainable fisheries management, conservation strategies and ecological research.Increased capacity benefits age-structured stock assessments that facilitate judicious fisheries resource management decisions commonly via science advice generated in CSAS processes which depend on high quality and consistent age-data. Commercial Fisheries programs are managed in partnership with stakeholders relying on scientific assessments and are dependent on consultative processes to develop and review policies, procedures and regulation.The implementation of AI pipelines are designed to augment age output and not meant to replace age readers. SCL institutional ageing knowledge acquired over 40 years of ageing experience must be maintained to ensure predictive age assignments remain precise and do not drift as a result of environmental pressures such as climate change.","Model training, testing and validation will continue with previously aged samples in order to increase samples robustness of the three aforementioned rockfish species and Chum. New species (Chinook, Quillback Redbandded and Widow rockfish) are currently in the process of scale imaging, and otolith weighing, imaging and IR scanning. The overall goal is to create a image, weight and IR libraries of all species aged within the SCL age catalog. Model training, testing and validation will proceed on all species when enough structure attributes have been attained. This is the metadata foundation that will support age predictive AI age modeling.Climate change, in the form of increasing water temperatures will diversely affect salmonid species causing variations in the physiological traits of growth and metabolic condition. Consequentially, driving a divergence from historical growth patterns causing interpretational difficulties that can result in the “smearing” of age classes. The creation of image based libraries has a two fold advantage; (1) it allows for automated predictive age assignments, and (2) it provides the ability to monitor changing growth rates by the direct measure of scale annuli. Measures of growth can provide information encompassing external environmental conditions as indicators of habitat quality, and internal physiological status of health, stress and reproductive state. The development of automated measures of annular growth are currently under investigation. As climate change becomes more prevalent the SCL expects that age requests will increase to compensate for the dynamic shifts in the ecosystem.Current plans for operationalization of real-time age prediction of Chum salmon are underway. This will rely on a Frame Work laptop that is specifically design to run the Chum age predictive models and the SCL’s high speed automated scale imaging camera. The series of events are as such; scale images will be auto captured from the high speed camera,an R-script will create image file names of species and specimen ID,all other attribute metadata such as measure of scale growth will be extracted,scale age will be predicted, recorded, and exported to the Mark and Recovery database."

In particular, we were able to differentiate 1) chum returning to the Chilliwack River versus the rest of the Fraser and 2) chum from spawning location in the SOG west versus SOG east. These improvements will improve stock assessment in those two areas.","GSI is routinely used in the Northeast Pacific to inform the management of Pacific salmon species, especially chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka), coho (Oncorhynchus kisutch), and chum (Oncorhynchus keta). Of these four species, chum is the most widely distributed in the Pacific Ocean, and displays the weakest population structure across its range. Chum is managed jointly by Canada and the United States under the Pacific Salmon Treaty to ensure that the fishery is sustainable on the long term, and GSI has become a pillar of effective stock assessment and management. Bilateral efforts between Canada and the USA have led to the development of GSI panels in each of the two countries, with bilateral collaboration ensuring a large overlap of SNPs between the panels developed in the two countries to foster exchange of data and results. The Canada chum GSI panel consists of 535 SNPs originally sourced from a series of RAD-seq (a genomic method to genotype thousands of genome-wide SNPs) studies targeting different parts of the range, but limited to Washington and Alaska (to be refined Small et al PSC report, Mckinney et al. 2020; Mckinney et al. 2022), and subsequently optimized independently from the USA counterpart. The Canadian baseline, the genetic database used as reference to assign samples of unknown origin to their stock of provenance, includes genotypic data for over 32,000 individuals from 384 collections across the species range (October 2025). Despite the genotyping efforts, some areas in southern BC remain poorly resolved, with two areas being of particular interest: the lower Fraser and SOG. In the Fraser, the Albion test fishery, which provides crucial information on chum returns for stock assessment, relies on accurate separation of Chilliwack River returns from the rest of the Fraser, but it is currently challenging. To avoid misassignment and increase accuracy, albeit at the cost of resolution, all collections from the Fraser are lumped into a single reporting unit. In the Strait of Georgia, two main reporting units are currently recognized: Howe-Burrard, including collections from Howe Sound and Burrard Inlet; and Strait of Georgia, including collections from the west and east side of the strait that are not included in the Howe-Burrard reporting unit. Even though assignment accuracy between these two reporting units is low with the current SNP panel, the analysis of the baseline samples suggest that additional efforts may help discriminate collections from the east and the west side of the Strait, thus increasing overall resolution in the SOG.","We used whole genome sequencing to fully characterize genome-wide sequence variation within the Fraser, SOG and adjacent areas, including Puget Sound, Johnstone Strait, and West Coast Vancouver Island. We sequenced 15 individuals from each of 45 collections in these areas (Fig.1), and called variants using stringent quality filters. We identified more than 11 million SNPs (excluding rare variants) across 594 individuals, which is 21,000X the number of SNPs included in the current GSI panel (535 SNPs). We performed Principal Component Analyses (PCAs) to investigate population structure. Analyses based on 100,000 randomly selected SNPs, a subsample of the full catalogue of genomic variation, showed great resolution improvement compared to the reference baseline including data from the 535 SNPs of the GSI panel (Fig.2): the Fraser, SOG and Puget Sound were markedly differentiated from each other, the North Puget collections were clearly separated from the rest of the individuals, and we started to observe differentiation between Chilliwack and Fraser, and SOG east and west. More focused analyses including only Fraser-Chilliwack or SOG samples revealed significant differentiation within those two areas. To identify a set of highly informative SNPs to add to the GSI panel, we calculated FST, a measure of genetic differentiation, across all SNPs within each of the two areas and selected the 100 SNPs showing the highest differentiation in each area (Fraser and SOG). We extracted the genotype data from the whole genome sequencing dataset for the SNPs in the GSI panel and the 200 highly differentiated SNPs in the Fraser and the SOG. 121 of the 535 SNPs in the GSI panel were not present in the whole genome dataset because they were either excluded due to quality and/or low minor allele frequency filters, or because they were not variable in the target geographic area. Using Leave-One-Out (LOO) analyses we tested for changes in GSI accuracy between the current GSI panel (414 SNPs) and the improved panel that includes the GSI panel and the 200 differentiated SNPs (614 SNPs). The addition of the 200 SNPs resulted in much improved assignments (Fig.3 and 4). When we tested the current GSI panel, assignments to the SOG had low true positive rates, indicating low assignment probabilities or misassignments, and individuals from each side of the strait showed similar probabilities to be assigned to SOG east or west (Fig.3). In the Fraser, Chilliwack individuals tended to be assigned to the rest of the Fraser, resulting in high false positive rate when the Fraser was the target reporting unit, and low true positive rates when the Chilliwack was the target reporting unit (Fig.3). In contrast, when we used the improved panel, all analyses showed low false discovery rate (FDR < 0.05) and high true discovery rate, hitting the target accuracy threshold of 80% of individuals assigned with 80% probability assignment, except for Chilliwack, which showed great improvement bu","A good understanding of population structure is crucial for the effective management of Pacific salmon, including chum. The latest study investigating population structure in BC and Washington is almost 20 years old, and was based on only 89 SNPs, granting rather limited resolution, especially in the Fraser and SOG (Small et al. . Additionally, the genomic data used to develop the current GSI panel were collected from American spawning locations only, and the genomic variation that is unique to Canadian stocks was not captured. With our work on chum funded by PSSI we have characterized population structure in southern BC and Puget Sound and identified SNPs that are highly differentiated and informative of population differentiation in the areas of interest. An improved GSI panel based on our results will greatly improve GSI resolution and accuracy in the Fraser and SOG, and beyond. We have been contacted multiple times in recent times for information on population structure in chum, both internally within DFO and by American agencies, to better inform stock assessment and management and hatchery practice. For example, apparent lack of population structure in the Fraser has led to the movement of chum of different origins among hatcheries. Our results provide evidence of population differentiation within the Fraser, which should be kept into account in hatchery practice to ensure the preservation of unique genetic diversity and potentially local adaptations to different parts of the Fraser watershed. Our NE Pacific range whole genome sequencing dataset will provide additional information on population structure across the chum North American range and a suite of ad hoc genomic analyses, including assessment of genetic diversity, demographic reconstructions, measures of genomic vulnerability to climate change, will provide information to prioritize conservation efforts and ensure long-term sustainability of fisheries.","In the coming months, we will perform additional assignment tests using individuals that were not originally included in the SNP discovery and GSI panel improvement analyses, and eventually add the informative SNPs identified to the current chum GSI panel. Dissemination of results at the Pacific Salmon Initiative Symposium has spurred interest into further characterizing fine population structure of chum in the Fraser and preliminary results are encouraging in this regard. We are also working on characterizing genomic areas of differentiation that could be associated with traits of interest, such as timing of migration. Finally, we’ll expand our investigations to the rest of the BC range and beyond as described above.The results of our study will result in an improved GSI panel that will help differentiate chum from different areas in southern BC at an unprecedented resolution, thus informing and improving hatchery practices and stock assessment."

The SSL predation that did occur was concentrated in Queen Charlotte Strait, not the largest rookery at Triangle Island. While SSL diet results are pending, SSL tagging data demonstrated evidence of restricted foraging during the initial portion of sockeye salmon migration (as animals are tied to breeding/pupping rookery) followed by rapid dispersal (particularly by males) away from Triangle Island and diverse foraging strategies among individuals. Widespread overlap of the SSL stock with migrating Fraser River sockeye salmon appears to be less than presumed.Collectively, these results suggest sockeye salmon may be vulnerable to a broader range of predators than previously considered, and that predator communities, and predation risk, vary through space and time. Thus, previous estimates of SSL consumption rates may be biased high.","Fraser River sockeye salmon productivity has been poor since the early 1990s (Peterman and Dorner 2012). Although the mechanism remains unclear and is likely multifaceted (Cohen 2012), bottom-up processes that reduce juvenile marine survival have been identified as a likely factor (McKinnell et al. 2014, Freshwater et al. 2018, Rechisky et al. 2019). More recently, elevated predation of returning adult Fraser River sockeye salmon by Steller sea lions (SSL) has been hypothesized to be a key factor (Walters et al. 2020). The primary pieces of evidence used to infer SSL impacts are a) large increases in SSL population size coincident with Fraser River sockeye salmon declines, b) the location of large SSL breeding colonies proximate to sockeye migration corridors (e.g., Triangle Island rookery at the northwest tip of Vancouver Island is the largest in northeast Pacific), and c) bioenergetic modeling that estimated significant removals (>1 million individuals) by SSLs if sockeye are 40% of the diet during four weeks in summer and all SSLs at British Columbia rookeries target sockeye during this period (Walters et al. 2020). Yet because there are no published estimates of SSL diet nor foraging distribution from rookeries and haul outs adjacent to sockeye salmon migration corridors, our current understanding of SSL foraging ecology is insufficient to validate key model assumptions. Furthermore, previous empirical estimates of sockeye salmon survival during their marine migrations do not have sufficient resolution to evaluate SSL impacts (Crossin et al. 2007, 2009). As a result, the impact of SSL, and other marine predators, on Fraser River sockeye salmon remains uncertain.","We used multiple methods to evaluate SSL foraging ecology, quantify sockeye salmon mortality rates, and ultimately draw inference on the likely impact of SSLs on migrating Fraser River sockeye salmon. The following activities occurred during the 2024 and 2025 field seasons (Figure 1). Sockeye Salmon MethodsSockeye salmon were captured aboard a charter purse seine vessel from sites near Rennell Sound (west coast Haida Gwaii; 2024 and 2025) and Queen Charlotte Strait (2025 only). Sockeye salmon were landed and transferred to a flow through seawater trough where biological data, including genetic stock identification (GSI) samples, were collected. Individuals in good physical condition were tagged with either an acoustic or satellite tag before being immediately released. We deployed acoustic transmitters on sockeye salmon (n=625) which allowed individuals to be detected on moored receiver arrays near Haida Gwaii, Triangle Island, Queen Charlotte Strait, throughout the Salish Sea, and the lower Fraser River. The acoustic receiver network included approximately 40 receivers deployed by DFO throughout coastal British Columbia, as well as infrastructure maintained by NOAA, the Ocean Tracking Network, Kintama, and the University of British Columbia. Detections data will be used to parameterize mark-recapture models to estimate survival rates along the migration corridor and identify hotspots of mortality. We also deployed popup archival satellite tags (PSATs) on a smaller number of sockeye salmon (n=35). After releasing from the animal these tags transmit light, temperature, and pressure sensor data that can be used to identify predator taxa (Seitz et al. 2019). Sockeye Salmon FindingsGSI results are currently only available for the 2024 field season; however, the majority (>98%) of tagged sockeye salmon were identified as belonging to Fraser River populations with Chilko Lake being the dominant conservation unit (~55% of all samples). Only a subset of detections data are currently available for 2025; however preliminary results in both years (Figure 2) indicate overall survival from Haida Gwaii to the Fraser River was poor (<8%). ~50% of individuals tagged at northern sites were detected on Haida Gwaii arrays; however, mark-recapture models that account for imperfect detection probability on these arrays are required for robust estimates of survival. Survival to the Fraser River of tags deployed in Queen Charlotte Strait was markedly higher (~40%). 2% of tags were detected in the study area after deployments were completed, suggesting short-term mortality due to tagging or handling was minimal. Only two tags were detected at Triangle Island (both in 2025), however 46 tags were detected in 2025 at sea lion haul outs throughout Queen Charlotte Strait. Importantly, additional analysis is required to determine how many of these fish were likely consumed by pinnipeds based on subsequent detections. No fish were reported as intercepted by fisheries in 2024, ","Although analyses are underway, there are several key preliminary results. We found that sockeye salmon mortality rates during adult marine migrations may be considerably higher than previously assumed (e.g. Cohen 2012). At the same time, it is clear that the predator community varies along the migratory corridor—while we found some evidence of pinniped predation in Queen Charlotte Strait that warrants additional investigation, we found no evidence of pinniped predation near Haida Gwaii where mortality rates were high and apparently driven by shark predation. Similarly, we found evidence that predation impacts likely vary among and within sea lion haul outs. Despite the large size of the Triangle Island rookery, we found a very small number of tags at this location, particularly relative to Queen Charlotte Strait haul outs. Steller sea lion satellite tag paths highlight important nuances in foraging behaviour during the months when Fraser River sockeye salmon are available. At this time of year, mature SSL are tied to pupping, nursing and breeding with only intermittent foraging. Peak pupping typically occurs early July. Females stay with their pups fasting for 1-2 weeks after which they make short foraging trips. Females appeared to disperse from Triangle by mid-August to other haul outs around Queen Charlotte Sound and WCVI. Males had very limited movements during the breeding period. Rapid and directed dispersal immediately post breeding (mid-July) was observed. Despite the large number of animals concentrated on Triangle Island during the breeding period (coincident with sockeye salmon migration), adjacent waters do not appear to be a major feeding ground this time of year. These foraging and dispersal patterns generally run counter to blanket assumptions for SSL impacts on sockeye and will have implications for foraging models. Ongoing diet analyses will provide additional information on individual, spatial, and seasonal variability in Steller sea lion foraging. Our results emphasize the impacts of at least three predator taxa (salmon sharks, blue sharks, Steller sea lions) on sockeye salmon warrant additional consideration. Given a potential latitudinal gradient in shark abundance (Williams et al. 2010, Proudfoot et al. 2024), population level impacts may be sensitive to where Fraser River sockeye salmon intercept the continental shelf during their return migrations. All else being equal, fish making landfall near Haida Gwaii will migrate through a longer gauntlet of predators than those making landfall in Queen Charlotte Sound, which may in turn be at greater risk than those migrating through Juan de Fuca Strait. The location of landfall is uncertain, but if it is correlated with diversion rate, as seems likely, will vary among stocks as well as among years (Grant et al. 2017). If we find evidence of year-specific differences in survival rate, consistent with expected density dependent effects on predator foraging behaviour, this will add ","Our findings highlight successful ecosystem-based management of sockeye salmon requires careful consideration of factors that are often overlooked when quantifying predator impacts. First, studies on predation impacts have focused on cetaceans and pinnipeds (Chasco et al. 2017a & b, Walters et al. 2020, Nelson et al. 2024), which have robust time series of abundance. However, the effect of pinniped impacts will be biased high if the abundance of multiple predator taxa have increased in synchrony. In this scenario, reducing cetacean or pinniped effects may simply result in the remaining predator taxa increasing in abundance. Second, bioenergetics models are commonly used to quantify the population level impact of predators (Chasco et al. 2017a & b, Walters et al. 2020); however, these methods are sensitive to assumptions about the relative contribution of different species and size classes to the diet (Nelson et al. 2021). These uncertainties are further amplified by seasonal and spatial variability in predator diets, as well as differences among individuals in foraging behaviour. Finally, the total impact on prey species is also sensitive to the proportion of the prey population that is vulnerable to predation. Our findings suggest that each of these components is highly relevant when evaluating Steller sea lion impacts on Fraser River sockeye salmon. In particular, we suggest ongoing and future work should address the following major dimensions. Seasonal and spatial variability in Steller sea lion diets should be quantified—this work will proceed using collected biochemical tracers. Seasonal, sex-specific variability in Steller sea lion distributions should be used to estimate the relative proportion of the population that is likely to overlap spatially and temporally with migrating sockeye salmon—this work could proceed using existing satellite and overflight survey data. Steller sea lion distributions should be paired with estimates of interannual and stock-specific variability in sockeye salmon migration routes to evaluate relative risk—this work is proceeding using historical catch data, but it is currently unclear whether existing data are sufficient. Since salmon-predator interactions are highly context-dependent (Wells et al. 2025), until the above data gaps are addressed efforts to mitigate predator impacts should proceed with caution and a careful consideration of the associated uncertainties."

Salmon surveys aimed to “follow” juvenile Chinook salmon as they enter marine waters from their natal rivers, and through the summer and first marine winter as they rear along the West Coast of Vancouver Island (WCVI). From 2023-2024, Chinook originating from Stamp River, Sarita River and Nitinat River were caught during their marine outmigration using seining and dip netting methods. In the Stamp River and Somass estuary, juvenile Chinook originating from Stamp River were caught through dip net and beach seine surveys with Hupacasath First Nation. In the Sarita Estuary, beach and purse seine surveys were led by Huu-ay-aht First Nation and LGL Limited and data and samples were shared with this project. In Nitinat Lake, beach seine surveys were carried out with Ditidaht First Nation to catch juveniles from the Nitinat River population. Juvenile Chinook from these populations were then caught during their first marine summer in Barkley Sound via purse seine surveys from 2022-2025 in collaboration with Huu-ay-aht First Nation and LGL Limited. Finally, juvenile salmon were followed through their first winter at sea with microtrolling surveys carried out in nearshore marine waters in Sooke Basin through Quatsino Sound on the WCVI. These overwinter surveys were carried out with 27 local First Nation and NGO collaborators from 2020-2025.","From 2020-2025, over 16,900 Chinook salmon were sampled under this project to collect information about salmon health, condition and distribution. Salmon were sampled non-lethally to measure fish length, height and weight and to collect a fin-clip sample to characterize stock of origin. Over 14,700 fin-clip samples were submitted to determine stock of origin using Genetic Stock Identification (GSI) and Parentage-based Tagging (PBT) methods. Over 5,100 juvenile Chinook of WCVI origin were lethally retained to obtain internal tissues for investigating fish health and condition. A total of 1,841 extracted stomachs were analyzed to understand diet composition during the first marine year and 1,300 scales were measured to estimate relative rates of growth. Whole bodies, otoliths and other tissues were also collected and provided to other projects under the Follow the Fish program to investigate juvenile Chinook life history, stress and disease, and exposure to contaminants and biotoxins.","Ultra Low Temperature -80 freezer",,,,,
