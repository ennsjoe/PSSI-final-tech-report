To address this gap, we are continu ing to refine existing threat estimates and develop ing new threats that are explicitly linked to stressor-response functions for cumulative effects and life-cycle modelling. For example, we have developed additional riparian disturbance metrics that better capture the impacts to riparian function (e.g., large-woody debris recruitment, disturbance to stream-shading, riparian filtering), which were not included in th e original report. Moreover, we are developing a stage-structured population model for Interior Fraser Coho (IFC) to estimate how stressors (estimate d threats) are influencing the population across their freshwater life stages. For this work, we are utilis ing the Cumulative Effects Model for Prioritizing Recovery Actions (CEMPRA), which applies stressor-response functions to account for the impact of stressors on vital rates and the overall population overtime and under different climate change and mitigation scenarios (Bayly et al . 2024). 

 Additional next steps for this work include expanding the cumulative threats model to other watersheds in the Pacific Region. To date, the model has also been applied to the Upper Bulkley Watershed to aid in salmon habitat restoration planning. Validation is an important step of most modelling exercises, though is often not a standard component of cumulative effect assessments (Halpern and Fujita 2013). Validating these threats through field verification and in situ data would be beneficial for threats that involve applied relationships and estimations, such as the flow accumulated loadings (i.e., nutrients, pollution, sedimentation). Future work could re-run the model at regular intervals to evaluate change in threats over time. Finally, additional analyses could quantify uncertainty in modelled threats and evaluate underlying assumptions through sensitivity tests.",NA | narrative not found: highlights | narrative not found: insights

Presented to SEP Planning and Assessment Unit, 13 Jan 2026.",NA,NA,NA,"S almonMSE is a decision-support tool developed for Pacific salmon founded on ‘management strategy evaluation’, MSE, which is an approach for evaluating the relative effectiveness of management actions using computer simulations that represent various possible realities of the fishery and the biological systems (Punt et al. 2016; openMSE 2023). To account for uncertainties, these simulations are repeated over numerous possible realities to produce a distribution of outcomes for each management action.

We developed a stage-based life-cycle model, capturing population processes relevant to Pacific salmon acting in freshwater and marine environments, and the impacts of harvest and environmental conditions on juvenile and adult stages. The underlying model structure is modular and flexible allowing for reduced complexity to simpler model forms when data are limited and increased complexity to address emerging threats when data are available. We included the ability to model an integrated hatchery population, whereby the hatchery and natural spawning components of a population are modelled separately but interact on the spawning grounds.

SalmonMSE provides advances relative to previously available tools that either did not consider risk and uncertainty or did not consider hatchery dynamics explicitly and therefore could not evaluate performance on hatchery objectives related to maintaining wildness of integrated hatchery populations, i.e., high PNI values ( Withler et al. 2018). By explicitly modelling hatchery impacts on populations, salmonMSE can evaluate performance on conservation, production and ‘wildness’ objectives. Our application to a case study on Sarita River Chinook salmon highlights the potential for trade-offs among objectives, suggesting that in some cases it may not be possible to achieve both wildness and high abundances simultaneously . Our case study further highlights that habitat restoration may be needed to support production objectives when survival in freshwater is limiting . An illustrative example is provided in Box 1. This tool fills a critical cap in DFO’s ability to strategically evaluate decisions on all three management levers. 

The salmonMSE tool is generic and can be applied across Pacific salmon species and populations. salmonMSE can be adapted to data availability, relying on coarse resolution survival rates (e.g., freshwater vs. marine) and meta-analyses, neighbouring populations, and expert opinion for parameterization when data are limited, and providing population-specific finer life-stage resolution and evaluating management actions targeting specific life stages where data are available. 

An open-source R package ( salmonMSE ) was developed to facilitate access of the tool, with three underlying repositories providing code for the R package and an application to one case study on the west coast Vancouver Island, Sarita River Chinook , and second on-going application to Upper Strait of Georgia Chinook to sup",NA,"A training session for technical analysts within DFO, First Nations and partner organizations will be hosted April 2026 to support implementation of salmonMSE. The intended outcomes for the workshop are for participants to understand the scope and capabilities of salmonMSE, have working knowledge of how to apply salmonMSE to simple examples that include integrated hatcheries, and understand how these can be expanded to include complexities in life-history diversity, environmental drivers, and harvest and hatchery management strategies.

S almonMSE is currently being applied to Upper Strait of Georgia Chinook salmon to inform the evaluation of harvest and hatchery management options for an upcoming FSAR process (planned for Nov 2026). We recommend the application of salmonMSE to inform fisheries stock advice for Pacific salmon more broadly, especially when harvest and hatchery levers are considered and conservation, harvest, and PNI objectives are identified. We further recommend exploring salmonMSE for SEP production planning, e.g., for evaluating alternative release strategies and broodtake rules.

Gaps remain in our ability to include environmental drivers and impacts of habitat restoration into salmonMSE. There are opportunities to combine salmonMSE with inferences from other habitat models or limiting factors frameworks, such as CEMPRA (Cumulative Effects Model for Prioritizing Research Activities) and RAMS (Risk Assessment Methods for Salmon), and causal modelling (e.g., using DSEM , Dynamic Structural Equation Models). Doing so would allow us to more clearly and transparently identify and document risks created by environmental or ecosystem conditions for achieving management objectives, and the relative benefits of more specific restoration efforts to mitigate those impacts.",NA,NA,NA | narrative not found: background | narrative not found: insights | narrative not found: next_steps

The following activities occurred during the 2024 and 2025 field seasons (Figure 1) . 

Sockeye Salmon Methods

Sockeye salmon were captured aboard a charter purse seine vessel from sites nea r Rennell Sound (west coast Haida Gwaii; 2024 and 2025) and Queen Charlotte Strait (2025 only). Sockeye salmon were landed and transferred to a flow through seawater trough where biological data, including genetic stock identification (GSI) samples, were collected. Individuals in good physical condition were tagged with either a n acoustic or satellite tag before being immediately released. W e deployed acoustic transmitters on sockeye salmon ( n=625) which allowed individuals to be detected on moored receiver arrays near Haida Gwaii, Triangle Island, Queen Charlot te Strait, throughout the Salish Sea, and the lower Fraser River. The acoustic receiver network included approximately 40 receivers deployed by DFO throughout coastal British Columbia, as well as infrastructure maintained by NOAA, the Ocean Tracking Network, Kintama , and the University of British Columbia. Detections data will be used to parameterize mark-recapture models to estimate survival rates along the migration corridor a nd identify hotspots of mortality. W e also deployed popup archival satellite tags (PSATs) on a smaller number of sockeye salmon (n=35) . After releasing from the animal these tags transmit light, temperature, and pressure sensor data that can be used to identify predator taxa (Seitz et al. 2019). 

Sockeye Salmon Findings

GSI results are currently only available for the 2024 field season; however, the majority (>98%) of tagged sockeye salmon were identified as belonging to Fraser River populations with Chilko Lake being the dominant conservation unit (~55% of all samples). Only a subset of detections data are currently available for 2025; however preliminary results in both years (Figure 2) indicate overall survival from Haida Gwaii to the Fraser River was poor (<8%). ~50% of individuals tagged at northern sites were detected on Haida Gwaii arrays; however, mark-recapture models that account for imperfect detection probability on these arrays are required for robust estimates of survival . Survival to the Fraser River of tags deployed in Queen Charlotte Strait was markedly higher (~40%). 2% of tags were detected in the study area after deployments were completed, suggesting short-term mortality due to tagging or handling was minimal . Only two tags were detected at Triangle Island (both in 2025), however 46 tags were detected in 2025 at sea lion haul outs throughout Queen Charlotte Strait. Importantly, additional analysis is required to determine how many of these fish were likely consumed by pinnipeds based on subsequent detections.

S almon surveys aimed to “follow” juvenile Chinook salmon as they enter marine waters from their natal rivers, and through the summer and first marine winter as they rear along the West Coast of Vancouver Island (WCVI). 

From 2023-2024, Chinook originating from Stamp River, Sarita River and Nitinat River were caught during their marine outmigration using seining and d ip netting methods. In the Stamp River and Somass estuary, juvenile Chinook originating from Stamp River were caught through dip net and beach seine surveys with Hupacasath First Nation. In the Sarita Estuary, beach and purse seine surveys were led by Huu-ay-aht First Nation and LGL Limited and data and samples were shared with this project .
