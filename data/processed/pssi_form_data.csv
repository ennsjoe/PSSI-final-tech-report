JO Thomas and Associates Inc.",Pacific Region,,,Marine,Pacific region,,,,"Bycatch of Pacific salmon in the groundfish trawl fishery has emerged as an important management issue due to the potential impacts on stocks of conservation concern, particularly for Chinook salmon, which constitute the majority of salmon bycatch. Beginning fall 2022, an enhanced monitoring program for salmon bycatch was implemented to provide accurate estimates of catch by species and to characterize the stock composition of Chinook salmon.
The monitoring program captured large fluctuations in Chinook salmon bycatch with total catches peaking at 26,273 individuals during the 2022/23 trawl fishery followed by a steep decrease to 7,040 individuals for the 2024/25 trawl fishery. This marked reduction coincided with the implementation of a salmon bycatch management plan in 2024, which included the introduction of a fleet-wide Chinook salmon bycatch cap of 9,500 individuals.
Representative sampling across three years of fishing improved our understanding of the stock composition of Chinook salmon bycatch, including stock-specific catches and catch of Chinook salmon coded-wire tag (CWT) indicator stocks. Across all years examined, the majority of Chinook salmon bycatch originated from stocks in the continental United States, whereas Canadian-origin bycatch was dominated by the Fraser River Fall 4(1) stock.","The Pacific Region groundfish trawl fishery is one of the largest commercial fisheries in British Columbia by catch volume and value. Management of the fishery is informed by a comprehensive monitoring program that includes mandatory electronic monitoring and dockside validation of all catch. In recent years bycatch of Pacific salmon, particularly Chinook salmon, has emerged as a management issue due to the potential for impacts on stocks of conservation concern. In trawl fisheries, salmon are a prohibited species that cannot be targeted or sold, but until recently monitoring requirements for salmon bycatch were no different than those applicable to all catch species and representative information on catch by stock were not available.

In collaboration with the Groundfish Trawl Research and Conservation Society, the groundfish trawl industry, non-profit organizations, and monitoring service providers, DFO developed an enhanced monitoring and sampling program for salmon bycatch to address knowledge gaps and inform management of the fishery. The program was designed to provide accurate estimates of salmon bycatch by species and determine impacts on Chinook salmon stocks of concern by estimating stock composition and coded wire tag catches. Enhanced monitoring was initiated in September 2022 and has continued until February 2026, covering multiple fishery years and informing the development a salmon bycatch management plan for the trawl fishery.","Commercial groundfish trawl catch is monitored and reported using a combination of fisher logs, audits of independent at-sea electronic monitoring, and dockside observer validation of landed catch. Prior to enhanced monitoring, Pacific salmon were required to be released and catch estimates were based primarily on fisher logs and at-sea observer data, with limited, opportunistic biological sampling of catch. Retention and sampling requirements for Pacific salmon were revised to enable accurate estimation of the number of salmon caught by species, and accurate estimation of stock composition for Chinook salmon catch. The key changes implemented as part of the enhanced monitoring program were to: 1) require mandatory retention of salmon bycatch from all option A trawl vessels (covering all vessels that fish using mid-water trawl nets); 2) independently validate all salmon bycatch, either during trip offloads by dockside observers or by sampling of retained heads; and 3) sample CWT and DNA tissue samples representatively from a subset of Chinook salmon bycatch.

The enhanced monitoring program provided independently validated estimates of salmon bycatch over three years of the groundfish fishery, with data collection currently ongoing for a fourth year. Monitoring procedures, analysis methods, and annual results were published in technical reports (Lagasse et al 2024, Lagasse et al 2025), providing the first comprehensive, publicly available reporting on salmon bycatch in the trawl fishery. The new monitoring requirements were successfully implemented for all Option A trawl vessels (over 35 active vessels each year) and nearly 12,000 Chinook salmon were identified to stock-of-origin using genetic stock identification (GSI), parentage-based tagging (PBT), and CWT methods. These samples were used to determine Chinook salmon stock composition and catch of CWT indicator stocks in a statistically representative manner.

Monitoring results revealed large fluctuations in salmon bycatch across years, while stock composition of Chinook salmon remained relatively stable. Chinook salmon bycatch increased drastically in 2022 coinciding with the first year of the enhanced monitoring program, peaking at a historic high of 26,237 Chinook salmon (out of 28,183 Pacific salmon) that was more than double any previous years since 2008. Bycatch remained relatively high during the following year with 21,696 Chinook salmon caught during the 2023/24 trawl fishery. Following implementation of a salmon bycatch management plan, Chinook salmon bycatch plummeted to 7,040 Chinook salmon for the 2024/25 trawl fishery. Stock composition across the three years of monitoring data showed that the majority of these Chinook salmon originated from the continental United States. Among Canadian stocks, most bycatch originated from the Fraser Fall 4(1) stock, which includes the Harrison River and Chilliwack River CWT indicator stocks.",,"The enhanced monitoring program represented three and a half years of salmon bycatch in the groundfish trawl fishery, however, ongoing monitoring is needed to inform management of the fishery and evaluate potential impacts on stocks of concern. The groundfish trawl fishery is a year-round, multi-species fishery that may vary in the distribution of effort and catch over time in response to regulations, market incentives, fish stock abundances, and other factors. Therefore, stock composition and catch patterns observed during the enhanced monitoring program should not be considered representative of future years. There is currently uncertainty in future funding and capacity for representative sampling of DNA tissue and CWTs to estimate stock composition, which may lead to information gaps in the future. Continued monitoring, along with communication and collaboration among the trawl industry, advisory groups, First Nations, and DFO, is important for the adaptive management of salmon bycatch in the trawl fishery moving forward.","Figure 1.

The enhanced monitoring program and changes to retention requirements began on September 22, 2022. Chinook salmon bycatch since February 21, 2025 is not yet available or shown.

The findings reveal key knowledge gaps in understanding BKD dynamics, suggesting the need for further research to build a fuller picture of the factors influencing disease transmission and prevalence.","Renibacterium salmoninarum, the causative agent of bacterial kidney disease (BKD), is endemic to the Pacific Northwest. Infection with this bacterial pathogen can result in significant morbidity and mortality in cultured juvenile Pacific salmon. Current BKD management relies on screening brood stock using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and excluding eggs from females exceeding the defined optical density (OD) threshold. This approach has significantly reduced the incidence of disease in both hatchery-reared juveniles and returning adult fish. The Salmonid Enhancement Program (SEP) maintains an extensive dataset that includes 16 years of ELISA broodstock screening results for many Vancouver Island and mainland Coho and Chinook stocks.
These datasets have not been previously subjected to a comprehensive epidemiological analysis to identify potential explanatory variables for BKD prevalence in stocks of concern. This project sought to address that knowledge gap by integrating ELISA data and linking broodstock ELISA values to Parental Based Tagging (PBT) information enabling stock-specific analyses. The work was conducted through a collaborative partnership among the Science Branch, SEP, and Aquaculture Management.","Methods
The study explored the relationship between parental BKD levels on individual salmon results while controlling for the impact of environmental factors such as thermal regimes by incorporating various temperature metrics, such as average temperature, minimum and maximum temperatures, degree days, and the number of days within specific temperature thresholds (6°C to 10°C). While Nitinat's temperature data was based on monthly or daily mean temperatures (depending on the year), Puntledge and Spius provided daily mean, maximum, and minimum temperatures. For each stock year, temperature data were filtered to include dates that a stock occupied the hatchery, e.g. the day of first broodstock captured to the day of last juvenile release. Juveniles of Chinook stocks were released less than a year of holding at the hatchery at Puntledge and after two years at Spius, while Coho stocks were released after 1 year and 2 year but temperature measurements were calculated based on the 2 year release for Coho stocks.
Data used in the analysis was from 2014 through 2023, and was dependent on data available in E-PRO and temperature data (Table 1). Only individuals with BKD value and maturity class information were included. Incomplete data points were filtrated out in each analysis. Dam's BKD optical density (OD) value and BKD level were attached to E-PRO records for progenies by matching progenies' dam DNA code to the dam's data in the report. This step was only possible for progenies with dam's DNA code and BKD OD value.
To guide the modelling of the vertical transmission path, we collaborated with an expert panel to develop a causal diagram (Figure 1). This exercise facilitated the identification and characterization of relationships across multiple scales, including the watershed, hatchery, and individual fish levels, while specifically assessing variables for their potential to confound the results. We evaluated these factors using a mixed-effects generalized linear model framework, designating the OD from the BKD ELISA as the outcome of interest and the OD of the progenitor (the dam) as the primary predictor. Temporal variation was integrated as a random effect to account for annual fluctuations. The final model incorporated several confounding factors, most notably the specific watershed of origin. We also included terms for interactions between mean temperature--which was scaled and centered by creek--and BKD prevalence at the stock level. For the purposes of this analysis, a stock was defined as a cohort of brood fish of the same species returning to the same creek during the same season, such as Nitinat Spring Coho. While species and season were initially tested, they were excluded from the final model as they were not statistically significant and did not meet the criteria for confounders; their observed effects were largely captured by spatial and temporal variables.
Research Findings
The primary analysis indicates that BKD levels in returning adults do not demonstrate a significant association with the OD levels of their progenitors. Instead, the relationship appears to be confounded by environmental and population-level factors, including water temperature, specific watershed characteristics, and the overall BKD prevalence within the returning population. For instance, while the watershed variable was not statistically significant in isolation, its inclusion in the model resulted in a measurable change in the coefficient of the primary predictor, suggesting a latent environmental influence. A more notable finding was the negative association between BKD levels and scaled temperature, which suggests that OD levels generally decrease as temperatures increase. However, a significant interaction between temperature and BKD prevalence indicates a modulating effect on this relationship (Figure 2). While lower temperatures appear to provide a more suitable environment for the transmission of BKD, a higher proportion of infected individuals within a population further intensifies this effect.
It is important to note, however, that the statistical model demonstrated a relatively low goodness-of-fit, indicating that a substantial portion of the variance in BKD levels remains unexplained by the variables currently under study. This suggests that the dynamics of BKD in these ecosystems are influenced by a complex array of factors--potentially including individual host immunity, varying hatchery practices, or additional environmental stressors--that were not fully captured in the present framework. Consequently, while the identified trends regarding temperature and prevalence offer valuable directional insights, they should be interpreted with caution and viewed as preliminary findings within a highly variable biological system.","This project contributes significant clarity to the understanding of BKD transmission by identifying that environmental and population-level factors often overshadow direct parent-to-offspring transmission in wild and enhanced stocks. By demonstrating that BKD levels in returning adults are more closely associated with watershed characteristics and thermal regimes than with the status of their progenitors, this research shifts the focus toward environmental stressors as primary drivers of disease expression. These findings highlight a critical pathway of effect where colder water temperatures facilitate higher pathogen loads, a relationship that is further intensified by the cumulative impact of high disease prevalence within the population. This identification of thermal and density-dependent ""modulating effects"" provides a more nuanced understanding of how multiple stressors interact to influence the health of salmon cohorts.
From a management and policy perspective, these insights inform risk assessment and hatchery planning by emphasizing that individual-level screening of broodstock may be insufficient without considering broader ecological context. The study provides a framework for evidence-based decisions regarding stock transfers and watershed-specific management, suggesting that biologically significant thresholds for disease may vary depending on local environmental conditions. By accounting for these spatial and temporal variables, managers can better navigate the trade-offs between enhancement goals and the risks of disease outbreaks.
<<<<<<< HEAD
A primary source of uncertainty in this analysis, however, stems from the operational protocols used to manage BKD in hatcheries. The standard practice of utilizing OD thresholds to cull high-risk eggs creates a filtered data set, as the most heavily infected vertical transmission paths are often removed from the population before they can be assessed in returning adults. Furthermore, when conservation concerns for at-risk populations supersede these culling protocols, it introduces additional variability into the transmission pathway. This management-induced selection bias limits our ability to fully quantify the role of vertical transmission, as the observed returning population primarily represents individuals that either passed through a selective screening process or were spared due to conservation priorities.

The findings reveal key knowledge gaps in understanding BKD dynamics, suggesting the need for further research to build a fuller picture of the factors influencing disease transmission and prevalence. The low goodness-of-fit of the current model indicates that additional variables, such as hatchery practices, genetic diversity, or other environmental and anthropogenic stressors, may play significant roles in shaping BKD dynamics. A promising avenue for research includes the use of simulation models to assess the impact of altering management practices, such as raising or lowering the positive-negative culling threshold OD value. This approach could help predict how adjustments to culling thresholds might influence disease prevalence and population outcomes under varying environmental conditions. Research should also focus on understanding potential thresholds or tipping points where environmental conditions, such as temperature extremes, significantly influence disease prevalence and outcomes.
The study's findings can inform proactive strategies for salmon conservation and management, particularly concerning how environmental conditions affect BKD prevalence. Managers could prioritize monitoring in watersheds where conditions, including temperature and BKD prevalence, elevate disease transmission risks. Additionally, the insights from simulations examining the effect of changing the positive-negative culling threshold OD value could guide policy and operational decisions to strike a balance between limiting disease spread and optimizing population sustainability.","The findings reveal key knowledge gaps in understanding BKD dynamics, suggesting the need for further research to build a fuller picture of the factors influencing disease transmission and prevalence.

We used statistical methods to understand how IHNV prevalence in adult fish relate to infection levels in fry, and how infection in fry affects infection in adults that return 3-4 years later.

>>>>>>> joe-temp
To compare how infection levels changed over time, we looked at timeseries data for each project site (Fulton, Pinkut, Nadina, Weaver) and for each life stage (fry, adult males, adult females). We used a clustering method that can line up patterns even when the timing doesn't match perfectly (a technique called dynamic time warping) to measure how similar the trends were.

To study how infection in returning adults affects IHNV prevalence in fry, we used a mixedeffects binomial model for proportions that accounted for differences between spawning years and project sites.

To study how fry infection affects infection in adults 3-4 years later, we used a similar model along with escapement data to calculate a weighted average of fry infection that matched the makeup of the returning adult population. Because the relationship wasn't linear, we also added a quadratic term to better capture the pattern.

RESULTS:
From 1987 to 2018, a total of 56,692 Sockeye salmon were screened for IHNV. Over this 32 year timeframe, the prevalence of IHNV infections varied annually within and between the four stocks sampled (Figure 2). Across the entire dataset, there was a positive correlation between the detection of IHNV in male and female samples; with the prevalence being generally higher in females than in males (Figure 3). Nonetheless, this prevalence in spawned females was not demonstrative of what was observed in fry, as there were numerous years where IHNV was not detected in the fry despite high prevalence in the broodstock. However, it appears as though the IHNV prevalence in fry is a strong predictor of the population's IHNV status upon returning adults 4 years later. For instance, fry with 50% IHNV prevalence are predicted to return as adults with a prevalence of 30 to 80% (Figure 4).","This work provides the first long-term dataset of infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) prevalence among various Sockeye salmon stocks in British Columbia and reveals a highly dynamic nature of this deadly virus. From this data, it was learned that when surveying adult fish, it is best to sample females as they have the highest prevalence. In naturally spawning populations of Sockeye salmon, it was found that the IHNV prevalence in broodstock offers little insight into the infection status of fry, as true parent to progeny transmission is unlikely. In many instances, high IHNV prevalence in adults did not result in the occurrence of virus in fry. However, unexpectedly it was discovered that IHNV prevalence in fry is significantly correlated to the prevalence of returning adults, suggesting IHNV in adults is partially explained by their status as fry and supports the role of a lifelong IHNV carrier state in perpetuating IHNV in Sockeye salmon populations.","This work illustrates the importance of long-term datasets in differentiating genuine trends from short term fluctuations and to uncover complex ecological dynamics. Analysis of IHNV prevalence across the four stocks over the 32 year timeframe revealed that prevalence across stocks is most similar within a river system, suggesting watershed or regional specific factors may influence level of IHNV in the system (Figure 5). Nonetheless, a shared prolonged reduction of IHNV observed across both Fraser and Skeena watersheds, suggests broader oceanic factor(s) are contributing to the occurrence of IHNV in Sockeye salmon (Figure 2). Given these trends, we are presently gathering environmental, management and other data to determine if there are correlates that are explanatory for these trends. In particularly, we are employing Pacea, an R package of ecosystem information, to link biological data with environmental variable to generate models and visualizations.","Figure 1.

Yukon First Nations",Yukon,Chinook salmon,Yukon River basin,Adult migrating in freshwater,Yukon,,,,"Yukon River Chinook salmon returns have remained critically low in recent years, causing immense hardship for Yukon river communities that have relied on salmon for subsistence, cultural practices, and food security for generations.
The causes of these declines are likely multifactorial; however, in recent years, large numbers of returning adults have gone ""missing"" during their freshwater migration in Alaska. This has raised concerns that mortality may be occurring after assessment programs enumerate Chinook passage from Alaska into Canada, potentially undermining the efficacy of fisheries management measures.
An international collaboration among DFO Science, Yukon Rivers Transboundary Area, Yukon First Nations, and the Alaska Department of Fish and Game tagged and tracked adult Chinook during their freshwater spawning migration to quantify migration related mortality.
Insights from this work can be used to inform precautionary buffers for a border passage goal (i.e., to account for post-border mortality) and in season management of total mortality (fishing and environment) all to support rebuilding and recovery efforts.
More broadly, the project has established significant infrastructure and catalyzed collaborations that will support continued monitoring and assessment for at least three more years.","Returns of Chinook Salmon to the Yukon River have been declining for over 30 years, with 2020 - 2024 seeing five of the lowest returns of Canadian-origin Chinook Salmon on record (Figure 1, Figure 2a). Coincident with these declines, substantial en-route freshwater migration mortality has been observed in some years before fish reach Canada. Estimates from assessments sites near the river mouth and at the international border suggest that, in certain years, more than 40% of Canadian-origin Chinook may have died prior to reaching Canadian waters (Figure 2b).

Estimates of natural mortality during the spawning migration in Canada are not available. As a result, fisheries managers work under the assumption that annual spawning escapement is equal to border passage minus any in-river harvest. Given the high levels of mortality observed in the Alaskan portion of the drainage in some years, this assumption has become increasingly tenuous and if violated has the potential to severely undermine fishery management measures and rebuilding and recovery. To help fill the knowledge gap, DFO Science and the Yukon Rivers and Transboundary Area partnered with the Yukon First Nation Salmon Stewardship Alliance (supported by Council of Yukon First Nations), Yukon First Nations, and the Alaska Department of Fish and Game to tag and track the fate of adult Yukon River Chinook salmon throughout their extensive freshwater spawning migration.","This project complimented tagging, telemetry tracking, and statistical models to estimate spawning migration mortality, alongside assessment of stock abundance and Conservation Unit (CU) status. Details of the latter are described in Connors et al. 2025 and here we briefly describe the tagging components of the work.

Adult Yukon River Chinook salmon were tagged in the lower Alaskan portion of the Yukon River in 2023 and 2024. Migration rates and fate of tagged fish were monitored using a network of remote tracking stations (RTS) deployed throughout Alaska and the Yukon Territory, supplemented by aerial telemetry surveys. Tissue samples were collected from each tagged fish and analyzed by the DFO Molecular Genetics Lab to assign individuals to Canadian Yukon River CUs. These genetic assignments identified the CU each fish was expected to reach. Tagged fish were also aged by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game ageing lab via scale samples. Sex of individual fish was determined by combined visual and genetic methods.
Remote tracking of Chinook salmon in the Canadian portion of the Yukon River was conducted using ATS R4500 receivers deployed at RTS sites. Beginning in 2023, DFO deployed four RTS: three along the mainstem Yukon River and one on the Porcupine River near Old Crow. During 2024, monitoring expanded substantially through a coordinated effort between DFO and the Yukon First Nations Salmon Stewardship Alliance (YFNSSA), undertaken with guidance from Yukon First Nations. This collaboration resulted in the deployment of 20 RTS towers across the basin (Figure 3). The RTS were strategically positioned throughout the Canadian drainage to monitor fish passage at key assessment locations. Stations at Dawson City and Rampart House detected Chinook salmon entering the Yukon Chinook Stock Management unit (SMU) and the Porcupine Chinook SMUs, respectively. Each RTS consisted of a 20 ft tall aluminum mast with antennas mounted at the top to maximize detection range and was installed on elevated riverbanks. Solar powered systems enabled continuous, autonomous operation throughout the migration period. The RTS network provided high-resolution data on movement patterns, timing, and fate of tagged Chinook salmon.
Aerial telemetry surveys were conducted using a Maule M-7 fixed wing plane flying at 300-600 m altitude and approximately 160 km hr ⁻¹. An ATS R4520 receiver was operated onboard with dualH antennas mounted to the wings. Flights followed the Yukon River mainstem and its major tributaries to detect tagged fish. Aerial surveys expanded spatial coverage and provided finer-scale movement information, including identification of migration dropouts and verification of spawning locations, thereby enhancing the spatial resolution and completeness of the telemetry dataset.
A hierarchical Bayesian mark-recapture model is in development to estimate survival by river segment and CU. This framework explicitly accounts for imperfect detections, small sample sizes, and uncertainty in genetic assignments. It will be used to derive annual and multi-year estimates of migration mortality by CU in relation to environmental conditions experienced during spawning migrations.
Preliminary analysis of the tagging data suggest Yukon Chinook migrate at an average of 51 km d-1 (range 38-63 km d-1 ), and the furthest distance travelled was over 3200 kms. In 2024, an estimated 85% of tagged Chinook likely reached their assigned CU spawning grounds. This compares to an estimate of 84% survival of migrating Chinook in the Alaskan portion of the river (as estimated by sonar projects at the river mouth and Yukon/Alaska border) in 2024 which is remarkably similar. If this relationship persists in subsequent years, in-season estimates of migration mortality derived in Alaska may help inform expected migration mortality in Canada and support development of precautionary buffers for bilateral border passage goals under the Yukon River Agreement.","This project has helped develop infrastructure, and catalyze international science based collaboration, to understand the ecology of spawning migration in Yukon Chinook that undergo one of the longest freshwater migrations of any Pacific Salmon. Through tagging, tracking, and statistical analyses we have started to be able to shed light on rates of freshwater migration and the magnitude of spawning migration mortality, by Conservation Unit. These insights can then be related to analysis that characterize population dynamics, estimate biological benchmarks, assess Conservation Unit statuses, and quantify expected biological and fishery consequences of current and alternative harvest management measures for Yukon Chinook.

The establishment of a network of water temperature monitoring stations that this project helped establish will help support water temperature monitoring for years to come and linking freshwater conditions to migration mortality.

Preliminary analyses suggest migration mortality can be well estimated by Conservation Unit and that tagging and telemetry based estimates of mortality in the Canadian portion of the river basin correlated with sonar based estimates in the Alaskan portion of the river. If this pattern holds with more years of data annual estimates of migration mortality in the Alaskan portion of the river can be used in-season to adjust expected migration mortality in the Canadian portion of the river and inform precautionary buffers for the border passage goal used bilaterally under the Yukon River Agreement.","Key next steps include:
development of hierarchical Bayesian mark-recapture models to estimate survival by river segment and CU in a statistically integrated manner that accounts for imperfect detections, small sample sizes, and uncertainty in genetic assignments and that can be scalable to incorporate future years' data.
continued tagging and tracking over at least three additional years, in collaboration with Yukon First Nations and the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, will expand sample sizes and strengthen inference across CUs and environmental conditions.
leveraging the insights from continued assessment to inform in-season precautionary buffers for border passage goals that reflect expected migration mortality in Canadian portion of river after Chinook salmon migrate past border.","Figure 1.

The project focuses on Clayoquot Sound, BC, but the methods are applicable for other regions in the west coast of Vancouver Island (WCVI).

Clayoquot Sound is comprised of several fjords located in close proximity of each other. Through this project, we were able to identify how and why conditions in these fjords differ. For instance, Tofino Inlet to the south has stronger freshwater inputs, is shallower and has a weaker connection with the shelf waters than northern fjords like Sydney and Shelter Inlets, leading to a fresher and warmer Tofino Inlet compared to Sydney and Shelter. Furthermore, the role of the sills (particularly the shallow one outside of Herbert Inlet) plays a leading role modulating the deeper waters of the inlets (due to strong tidal mixing at the sill and strong tidal advection).
Monitoring of oxygen concentrations in Clayoquot Sound showed that oxygen conditions can reach levels that are stressful for Pacific salmon in all seasons and even close to the surface.
Future scenarios suggest that all of Clayoquot Sound will become warmer, while salinity will not change significantly. Fjords that are generally warmer in present-day simulations, like Tofino, are more at risk of exceeding temperature thresholds that can stress Pacific salmon.","Salmon spend time in fjords and inlets once they leave their rivers and before they venture into the open ocean. The conditions they encounter in these nearshore environments may be crucial for their success at later life stages. But, what are these conditions like and how may they change with climate? This project aims at answering those questions, with a focus on Clayoquot Sound and making use of both numerical models and observations.

We established a monitoring program in this region, in collaboration with local indigenous groups (Ahousaht First Nation, Hesquiaht First Nation, Tla-o-qui-aht First Nation, Uu-a-thluk Fisheries, Nuu-cha-nulth Tribal Council, and Maaqutusiis Hahoulthee Stewardship Society). We supported them with funds, training, and/or materials to sample vertical profiles of temperature, salinity, and oxygen every month in their territorial waters. This project also helped maintain our existing weather station network (mostly installed in finfish farms) and supported the deployment of two moorings inside the inlets to obtain timeseries of currents, temperature, salinity and oxygen. All of these data have supported the development and evaluation of the WCVI model, which can represent observed conditions in the near past (referred to as ""present-day"") and represent expected conditions under a future scenario.","Our observational methods are traditionally used in oceanographic research, e.g. sampling temperature, salinity and oxygen profiles with a CTD instrument as well as deploying moorings and weather stations. However, the innovative aspect is the collaboration with local communities. These collaborations allowed for sampling at a much higher frequency (~monthly) than anything achievable by DFO alone, but still maintaining DFO's high-quality data standards (thanks to training and data post-processing and quality control by DFO). As a reference, DFO-led sampling provided 82 CTD profiles in 2019 (mostly from March and October/November) and 122 profiles in 2024 (a well-sampled year through many PSSI projects), while this project's Nation-led sampling in 2024 provided 150 profiles (mostly monthly from March to December). Beyond the scientific benefits, these collaborations were essential for building long-term relationships with First Nations partners, fostering mutual trust, and creating a framework for ongoing knowledge exchange between Indigenous knowledge systems and western scientific approaches.

In terms of modelling, the WCVI model has been developed and run for 2019, 2024 (to take advantage of the intensive PSSI-related sampling) and one future scenario centered in 2055. Simulations for 2019 and 2024 have been compared against observations and show good agreement, particularly temperature and salinity. Biogeochemical variables (e.g., oxygen, nitrate) show good performance on the shelf, but some further calibration is needed to reach the desired performance inside the inlets. Figure 1 shows the model domain and bathymetry.

Analyses of model outputs in Clayoquot Sound indicate that the inlets towards the south are warmer and fresher than those on the north at all levels of the water column and all three seasons analyzed (spring, summer, autumn). These conditions are due to stronger freshwater inputs, shallower bathymetry and a less direct connection with the shelf waters in southern inlets (Tofino to Bedwell) compared with northern inlets (Herbert to Sydney). In particular, model results allowed to study the role of the sills (particularly the shallow one outside of Herbert Inlet), which play a leading role modulating the deeper waters of the inlets (due to strong mixing at the sill and strong tidal advection).

When comparing model results against temperature values that result in stress responses by Chinook salmon (above 16 to 18°C, personal communication by PSSI colleague Christoph Deeg), we find that the surface waters of all inlets may exceed these thresholds in summer under present-day conditions (Figure 2a). Furthermore, Tofino Inlet shows waters above these thresholds at all depths (Figure 3). When analyzing the same thresholds under the future scenario, they are exceeded mostly everywhere in the Sound in the top 5 meters (Figure 2b,c), and exceeded at depth in the southern inlets (from Bedwell to Tofino).

Once the performance of the biogeochemical module of the WCVI is deemed appropriate, a similar analysis will be performed with oxygen, considering that salmon show signs of stress at environmental values lower than 6 to 8 mg L-1 (Christoph Deeg, personal communication). Nevertheless, from the observational record we find that Clayoquot Sound shows throughout the year oxygen concentrations that fall below these thresholds, even near the surface from spring to autumn (Figure 4).

Two peer-reviewed publications are being prepared to discuss these results, while two manuscripts are already published discussing the low near-surface oxygen conditions (Rosen et al, 2022) and describing the model (Foreman et al, 2024). Informal presentations and updates were provided regularly to Gemma Macfarlane, the Stewardship Biologist from Maaqutusiis Hahoulthee Stewardship Society from Ahousaht Nation, as well as to project collaborators. A formal presentation was provided at the last Pacific Salmon Science Symposium in December 2025 and two other ones are scheduled in January and March 2026 to the Maa-nuult Joint Fisheries Committee (JFC) Technical Meeting Series and the State of the Pacific Ocean meeting, respectively. A presentation at a scientific meeting was planned for February 2026, but travel was not approved.","This project has added key oceanographic information related to known salmon stressors (temperature, oxygen) to help understand the environment encountered by salmon while migrating towards/from the open ocean. Furthermore, future scenarios provide a management framework to assess how these environments may change over time, allowing for decisions, policy and/or plans to access useful information in case they need to adapt to future conditions. Most importantly, this project created at tool that can be further applied, e.g. by looking into other inlets or sounds as well as by expanding the model or its analysis to include other variables.

In summary, this work has shown that the thermal tolerance of salmon can be exceeded in the southern inlets of Clayoquot Sound (particularly Tofino Inlet and especially in summer). Furthermore, the future scenario we analyzed (based on a ""business as usual"" scenario centered in 2055) shows an increase in the volume of waters that exceed the thermal threshold throughout Clayoquot Sound. While a less crucial stressor, we studied salinity and its potential future changes, since salmon-affecting bacteria may increase at higher salinities. We are still working on the model improvements needed to extend the analysis to oxygen conditions, which are also vital for salmon health, but observational analysis indicates that concentrations below the optimal range for salmon are ubiquitous in Clayoquot Sound.","The first next step would be to extend current analyses to other Sounds of WCVI, beyond Clayoquot Sound. But it is noteworthy that while this project has focused on temperature and oxygen, the model provides a larger set of environmental variables. Future studies could expand and deepen the analysis of existing model results, investigating the potential role of changes in other ecosystem variables currently modelled (e.g., phytoplankton, zooplankton, nutrients, etc.). Furthermore, future projects could extend the model capabilities by including the carbonate system and/or submerged aquatic vegetation modules. The former would allow for the study of ocean acidification as an environmental stressor and the latter could inform the understanding of climate change in habitat quality. Both modules are available within the modelling framework, but not yet applied to the WCVI model.

Since warming temperatures and declining oxygen concentrations will be issues affecting nearshore environments utilized by Pacific salmon, it would be crucial for salmon conservation and management to consider, mitigate, and adapt to these factors as climate changes.","Figure 1.

These estimates will be combined with climate projections to estimate how future conditions may impact salmon populations in future decades.
Key initial findings, based on the 13 populations model:
Environmental drivers and life stages influencing future impacts vary among populations.
All assessed populations are sensitive to projected changes
Negative impacts are expected to be greatest in southern regions (Columbia, Fraser, WCVI) and driven by increased marine temperatures and freshwater temperatures during adult migrations, while some northern populations may initially benefit from warming.

These projections will help identify the life stages most vulnerable to climate change and guide management strategies by highlighting population-specific sensitivities.","Many sockeye salmon populations have declined in abundance despite reductions in harvest, suggesting reduced productivity driven by environmental forcing, with poor marine survival identified as a key contributing factor (Peterman and Dorner 2012, Connors et al. 2020). Yet some sockeye salmon populations are stable or increasing (Brown et al. in press, Ogden et al. 2024). The cause of divergent trends in abundance is unclear, resulting in considerable uncertainty about which sockeye salmon populations are most likely to be resilient to changing environmental conditions.

Evaluating future risk requires information on both population-specific stressors and biological responses to those stressors. Although quantitative climate change vulnerability assessments have been performed for a number of Pacific salmon populations, they have largely focused on American Chinook salmon populations from a small number of watersheds (e.g. Crozier et al. 2021). Here we leveraged a unique dataset of juvenile and adult abundance from a network of thirteen sockeye salmon populations extending from the Columbia River to northern British Columbia. We parameterized an age-structured life cycle model that included freshwater and marine covariates to estimate population-specific functional responses, then evaluated how populations fared under various climate change scenarios. Our study incorporated expertise from diverse collaborators, within and outside DFO, with expertise in stock assessment, global climate models, and salmon ecology. Our work can be used to identify Pacific salmon life stages that are most vulnerable to climate change and help prioritize management interventions.","Overview of the modelWe developed a full life cycle model that consists of two stages: 1) spawner to smolt production and 2) smolt to adult recruit survival (Figure 1). Each stage of the model consists of a Beverton-Holt function, where density-independent production (i.e., survival) is a function of the environmental conditions experienced in that life stage. We modelled each age class separately because sockeye salmon vary in the number of years that they spend rearing in freshwater as well as in the ocean, and covariates were lagged so that each age class was only affected when it overlapped in space and time with a given covariate.

We used a state space approach that linked population dynamics to the observed data and accounted for cyclical feedback among generations. This structure allowed us to account for missing data, observation error, and variation in the life stage that was observed for juveniles (smolt vs. fry). The model was implemented in Stan and fit using Bayesian inference within a hierarchical framework, allowing information to be shared across populations.

Salmon data
Our model is based on thirteen populations of sockeye salmon (Figure 2) where there are estimates of spawner abundance, juvenile abundance (smolt or fry), and adult recruitment. In addition, we have estimates of age structure for juveniles, adult recruits, or both. These populations come from six different watersheds spanning the entire province of BC: Columbia, Somass, Fraser, Skeena, Stikine, Taku. We included data from 1981 to 2024 in our model.

Environmental covariates
We selected environmental covariates based on our understanding of the sockeye salmon lifecycle and when and where the populations experience different conditions. To do this, we developed a directed acyclic graph (DAG; simplified version in Figure 2) that outlines our hypothesized causal effects, as well as our understanding of how environmental covariates influence each other or are influenced by shared drivers (e.g., a common regional climate). We were unable to include all hypothesized covariates, because in many cases we do not have appropriate data for all populations. For example, we know that zooplankton community composition is likely to influence survival (Peterson and Schwing 2003) and that zooplankton dynamics are in turn influenced by temperature and mixed layer depth (Mackas et al. 2012). Thus, based on our model structure, we can interpret any effects of marine temperature and mixed layer depth as being, at least partially due to their effects on zooplankton. In this way, we use the DAG to understand whether our estimated environmental effects are likely to be biased or confounded, and to adjust our model and interpretation accordingly.
The environmental covariates (Figure 3) that we hypothesized could influence spawner to smolt production were: 1) winter (Oct. to Mar.) rearing temperatures (2 or 3 years after spawning), and summer (Apr. to Sep.) rearing temperatures (1 or 2 years after spawning) in nursery lakes. The environmental covariates that may influence smolt to adult recruit survival were: 1) near surface temperature averaged across the juvenile marine migration route for the period of April to June; 2) mixed layer depth averaged across the juvenile marine migration route for the period of April to June; 3) near surface temperatures in the open ocean in summer (Jul. to Sep., 1 or 2 years after ocean entry) and winter (Jan. - Mar.; 1,2, or 3 years after ocean entry); 4) river temperature during upstream migration , 5) river discharge during upstream migration.

Freshwater temperatures and discharge were sourced from the Pacific Climate Impact Consortium (Werner et al. 2019). The juvenile marine migration route is defined as all polygons in Figure 2 from the point of ocean entry for each population and north to Alaska along the continental shelf (i.e., depths less than 500 m). The open-ocean domain was defined by a rectangular polygon in the North Pacific, bounded by 170°W, 145°W, 60°N, and 45°N; areas shallower than 1000 m and regions north of the Aleutian Islands were excluded. Coastal temperature and mixed layer depth were sourced from the BCCM downscaled climate model (Peña and Fine 2024), the HOTSsea model (Oldford et al. 2024) and the GLORYS12 reanalysis (E.U. Copernicus Marine Service Information (CMEMS). Marine Data Store (MDS)). Open ocean temperatures were sourced from GLORYS12.

Future projections
We are still in the process of integrating our model with future climate projections.
This will be done by taking the estimated parameters of our model and applying them to averaged historical (1995 to 2025) baseline conditions as well as future projected (2041 to 2070) environmental conditions. This will allow us to estimate how the mean number of adult recruits per spawner is expected to change between these two periods, due to climate change. We plan to contrast the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 future climate scenarios to assess how sensitive our projections are to the specific emission scenario. Future climate projections will be sourced from the BCCM (Pena et al.) model, downscaled CMIP6 model (ACTEA) and PCIC (citation).

Initial results
We find that all populations are sensitive to environmental change at some point in the lifecycle (Figure 4). However, there is considerable variation across populations as to where in the lifecycle environmental conditions have the greatest impact. Southern populations (WCVI and Columbia) appear to be most sensitive to changes in the early marine stage. Fraser and Columbia populations appear to be most sensitive to warm waters experienced during upstream migration. In contrast, summer temperatures during lake residence had a relatively small effect on recruitment for all populations. Northern populations show greater variability in their responses, and some may even benefit from some degree of warming.","Although we are still integrating our population model with future climate projections, our preliminary results highlight striking similarities and differences among sockeye salmon populations that are relevant to management. The majority of populations showed marked declines in abundance as marine and freshwater temperatures increase. Yet the life stages and environmental drivers regulating future impacts varied among populations. These patterns suggest management interventions will be most effective if they are applied in a regional or population-specific context and target life stages that have the greatest impact on subsequent recruitment.

More broadly, our findings emphasize the value of leveraging life cycle models when evaluating climate change risk. Climate change vulnerability assessments often rely on predicted changes in putative stressors, rather than population level responses to those stressors. Such frameworks implicitly assume that populations respond similarly to, for example, one degree of warming. Furthermore, without clear linkages to a biological response, it is often challenging to evaluate the relative impact of stressors in different spatial domains (e.g., freshwater vs. marine temperatures) or representing different physical processes (e.g., changes in temperature vs. flow). Although qualitative approaches are necessary in data limited scenarios, uncertainties should be clearly communicated to decision makers.

Despite its complexity, our model only incorporated abundance data from three life stages, limiting our ability to precisely link indicators to biological responses. Marine spatiotemporal distributions are also relatively poorly resolved, particularly for more data-limited northern populations and for all populations during offshore residence. Both of these factors will increase the uncertainty associated with effect size estimates. Additionally, we could only incorporate indicators that were readily available in historical time series and climate projections, and we assumed that ecological responses to environmental drivers would remain constant in the future. Such assumptions are necessary in correlative models where the mechanisms linking, for example, temperature to survival remain unknown, but may lead to biased estimates of life stage-specific effects. Given the complexity of ecological systems (e.g., non-stationarity; Litzow et al. 2019), our predictions should be viewed cautiously and revised as additional data become available.",,"Figure 1.

Results differ among inlets. The sediment core trends indicate a change toward a longer, less nutritious food web in some inlets but not others. Further work will explore the data more deeply to provide a robust interpretation in the context of climate-linked changes in freshwater inflow, productivity and seawater circulation.

The final results of this project will be available to inform the new, ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management on the BC coast.","Until recently, fisheries models ascribed the decline in Salish Sea salmon populations to a 30% decrease in total primary productivity since the 1970s. Geochemical data (Johannessen et al., 2021, CJFAS) have since shown that total productivity has been constant for the last century in the Salish Sea. However, a change in the type of productivity could have affected salmon, by changing the nutritional value of available food. In addition, it is not known whether total productivity has changed outside the Salish Sea. A change from diatom- to dinoflagellate-dominance is thought to have occurred in nearby Puget Sound, due to a change in the ratios of dissolved nutrients and in the timing of freshwater discharge.

This project relates to drivers of salmon decline. Once complete, the results will be available to inform ecosystem models used to set fisheries catch limits. In the context of the new requirement for ecosystem variability to be included in salmon stock assessment, it will be crucial for fisheries managers to understand changes in the food web and in the physical and chemical properties of coastal seawater.

In addition to interpreting trends in primary productivity, based on sediment cores, the PI will collaborate with a biological oceanographer (Akash Sastri, DFO) and an American chemical oceanographer with data from Puget Sound (Christopher Krembs, Washington State Dept. of Ecology). The collaborations will permit a comparison with a time series of plankton taxonomic data and put the results from BC inlets into a wider regional context. The results will be published in scientific papers and in a proposed CSAS Science Response.",,"Results to date indicate that each inlet tells its own story. Knight Inlet, for example, has about twenty times the terrigenous carbon flux of Roscoe Inlet (Figure 2). However, the marine bloom flux (related to high productivity and a short (nutritious) food chain) is only five times as high in Knight as in Roscoe, and the non-bloom flux is similar in the two inlets. This indicates that the ratio of highly nutritious to less nutritious food at the base of the salmon food web is likely higher in Knight than Roscoe Inlet. In addition, the trends over time are different in the two inlets (Figure 2). It is possible that fisheries management in inlets will require inlet-specific consideration of environmental variables. Once the sediment core interpretation is complete and is put into the environmental context of each inlet, this information will be available to inform the ecosystem models that support salmon stock assessment.",,"Figure 1.

Targeted surveillance revealed differences in pathogen prevalence among salmon stocks and tissues, with F. psychrophilum more frequently detected in spleen samples than kidney, alongside observed genetic diversity in isolates. For R. salmoninarum, ELISA testing was more reliable than qPCR, with non-lethal sampling methods under ongoing evaluation.
Improved diagnostic tools enhance pathogen detection and understanding of disease prevalence, aiding targeted interventions in salmon hatcheries.","Historically, Fisheries and Oceans Canada's (DFO) Salmonid Enhancement Program (SEP) has worked closely with the Science Branch's Aquatic Animal Health (AAH) Section to implement disease monitoring and mitigation programs aimed at reducing the impacts of endemic diseases in salmonid hatcheries. These efforts are critical for maintaining hatchery productivity and supporting broader salmon conservation and enhancement objectives. However, reductions in funding for salmon health research within both SEP and the Science Branch have limited the ability of the Finfish Diagnostic Laboratory (FDL) at the Pacific Biological Station (PBS) to modernize and adopt emerging diagnostic technologies. As a result, diagnostic capacity has not kept pace with current best practices, and opportunities for effective technology transfer between Science Branch and SEP have diminished.
This project sought to address these knowledge and capacity gap by re-establishing strong linkages between SEP and the Science Branch and leveraging scientific expertise to improve, expand, and modernize the FDL. The demand driving this work is the need for timely, accurate, and advanced diagnostic information to support proactive salmonid hatchery health management. Through strengthened collaboration among SEP, BC Centre for Aquatic Health Sciences, and Science Branch, a multi-year initiative was implemented that will result in sustainable disease monitoring and mitigation, ultimately improving hatchery health outcomes across SEP facilities.","Validation and transfer of diagnostic assays for endemic pathogens
In consultation with SEP veterinarians and fish health staff, the project identified seven endemic pathogens for which there was a need for improved diagnostic assays. Due to the need for high-capacity and rapid diagnostics, quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays were chosen for their accuracy and reliability. The targeted pathogens were as follows: Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae (Bettge et al., 2009), Flavobacterium columnare (Gibbs et al., 2020), Flavobacterium psychrophilum (Ma et al., 2019; Marancik & Wiens, 2013), Renibacterium salmoninarum (Richmond & Plant, 2021), Ichthyophthirius multifiliis (Howell et al., 2019), IHNV (Purcell et al., 2013), and Nucleospora salmonis (Badil et al., 2011). Where pathogen nucleic acids were unavailable, synthetic double-stranded DNA fragments (gBlocks™) were used for validation work, e.g. limits of detection and quantification. In collaboration with BC Centre for Aquatic Health Sciences, the R. salmoninarum qPCR assay underwent interlaboratory validation in which both labs screened 170 samples. The results showed substantial agreement between labs (Cohen's κ=0.68), confirming the reliability of assay transfer. Post-validation, assays were implemented to assist the FDL in disease investigations.
To ensure effective knowledge transfer, standard operating procedures were developed by the AAH team and shared with FDL staff. Training sessions covered all aspects of assay implementation, enabling FDL personnel to independently conduct analyses.
Deployment of assays for pathogen surveillance
In addition to assay validation and technology transfer, this project also focused on collection and analysis of longitudinal data on two high-priority pathogens: F. psychrophilum and R. salmoninarum. F. psychrophilum is the causative agent of bacterial coldwater disease and infections can cause significant disease and mortality in juvenile, hatchery-reared salmonids. Identified knowledge gaps for F. psychrophilum in BC include overall prevalence in broodstock, and the linkage between female broodstock bacterial load and outbreaks in fry. While outbreaks are common at most SEP facilities rearing salmonids, outbreaks are notably acute in Harrison River Chinook salmon (HRCS).
Surveillance conducted between 2023 and 2025 determined that prevalence was approximately 40% in HRCS broodstock during 2023-2024, with a significant reduction in 2025 (χ2=12.6, p < 0.01) (Table 1). It is possible that prevalence is cyclical in this stock but additional screening is necessary. Chehalis River broodstock, reared under similar conditions, showed comparable infection rates to HRCS in 2024, suggesting genetic differences between stocks may influence outbreak intensity.
Both kidney and spleen were collected to determine which tissue would be best for routine sampling. Agreement between the two tissues was slight (Cohen's κ=0.16). The number of positive fish based on spleen results was more than double that of kidney indicating that spleen is more likely to result in a positive detection. Tissues were also streaked on bacterial agar and evaluated for growth of yellow-pigmented bacteria morphologically similar to F. psychrophilum. Using novel sequencing techniques, we identified unexpected genetic heterogeneity within F. psychrophilum isolates from BC.
In 2024, the SEP Fish Health group conducted a pilot study to evaluate the effectiveness of pre-fertilization egg disinfection in reducing bacterial loads. Unfertilized eggs from 20 HRCS females were treated in an Ovadine®:saline solution (100 ppm:0.75%) for 15 minutes. Egg disinfection is typically carried out post-fertilization; however, iodophor cannot penetrate eggs to eliminate bacteria already present within. A previous study by Lennox et al. (2023) suggested that pre-fertilization disinfection in an iodophor:saline solution may decrease intra-egg bacterial concentrations, supporting the basis for this pilot. Eggs from each female were sampled at three key stages (pre-fertilization and pre-treatment, pre-fertilization and post-treatment, and post-fertilization and post-treatment) and screened for F. psychrophilum by AAH staff. The number of positive samples decreased from eight (pre-treatment and pre-fertilization) to one (post-treatment and post-fertilization). Fish were not monitored post-hatch, so long-term effectiveness of the treatment could not be assessed, though no adverse impacts on fertilization or hatching were noted.
The study was repeated in fall 2025, expanding to include all HRCS eggs as well as all chum salmon eggs at the Tenderfoot hatchery. Samples from the HRCS eggs were collected and will be analyzed using qPCR before the end of the fiscal year to further evaluate the efficacy of this treatment approach.
R. salmoninarum is the causative agent of Bacterial Kidney Disease (BKD), and is vertically transmitted from female broodstock to progeny. As such, kidney is collected from spawning female broodstock and submitted to the FDL for BKD screening using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In the current study, 637 samples were screened by ELISA and qPCR. Assay agreement was slight (Cohen's κ=0.20), and overall, more samples were positive by ELISA as compared to qPCR. The ELISA measures bacterial antigen concentrations and serves as a proxy for previous R. salmoninarum exposure. Conversely, the qPCR measures the total amount of nucleic acid present, i.e. an active infection. Therefore, although the R. salmoninarum qPCR assay is sensitive and specific, the ELISA remains the gold standard method for broodstock screening. Longitudinal surveillance of select stocks was also conducted from 2023 through 2025 (Table 2). Prevalence, as determined by ELISA, is high at these facilities every year. Results from 2025 are pending but will be available by the end of this fiscal year.
This project also explored the use of non-lethal sampling methods for R. salmoninarum. To do so, lethal (kidney) and non-lethal (mucus, gill clip, anal fin clip, and ventral swab) samples were collected from female broodstock at Nitinat and Big Q hatcheries. All samples were screened by the qPCR assay and kidney was also screened by ELISA (Table 3). In 2024, results showed limited agreement between non-lethal samples and kidney, with mucus samples providing the highest detection rates. Given the amount of handling during the spawning process, mucus also has the highest risk of contamination. Consequently, mucus sampling was excluded in 2025, with evaluation ongoing for gill clip and anal fin sampling methods.","This project has provided new information about salmon populations and their health by generating data on the distribution and detection of various pathogens. By employing molecular diagnostic tools like qPCR, the study has documented pathogen presence in juvenile and broodstock salmon populations, contributing to an improved understanding of pathogen dynamics in these systems. The longitudinal data gathered offers insight into how pathogen prevalence varies among different salmon stocks and over multiple years.
The results of the project can inform certain aspects of salmon management. For example, the findings regarding pathogen screening in broodstock populations may assist in reviewing fish movement protocols or stock enhancement practices. Additionally, evaluation of pre-fertilization egg disinfection suggests a potential approach that could be further explored as a disease prevention tool for hatcheries, particularly in relation to bacterial coldwater disease. The study also identified important considerations related to tissue type variability in pathogen detection, which highlights potential trade-offs when exploring non-lethal sampling methods screening broodstock for R. salmoninarum. These findings are relevant for hatchery planning and emphasize the importance of balancing disease mitigation efforts with the logistical and operational constraints of hatchery facilities.
This research also provides additional information about factors influencing salmon health, such as stressors and potential risk pathways related to pathogen transmission, hatchery practices, and environmental conditions. While the findings highlight areas for further research or development, the project offers practical data that may aid in specific management decisions, operational guidelines, and planning for salmon conservation efforts.","The findings from this project have identified several knowledge gaps and areas for further study. With respect to R. salmoninarum, future efforts should focus on analyzing existing data to evaluate prevalence trends across different stocks over time, refining qPCR assays to improve diagnostic reliability, and optimizing non-lethal sampling methods. For F. psychrophilum, additional research is needed to investigate genomic differences among BC-specific isolates and potential influence on virulence. Continued investigation into stock- and year-specific variations in pathogen prevalence, particularly in high-risk stocks, will further clarify susceptibility patterns and inform management strategies. Additional work on evaluating the efficacy of pre-fertilization egg disinfection is necessary to assess its role as a disease prevention tool.
This project also emphasizes the need for standardized diagnostic practices and improved methods for pathogen detection to reduce uncertainties in disease monitoring. Strengthening partnerships between the Science Branch and SEP is vital to hatchery health management. By improving access to advanced diagnostic technologies, and supporting the capacity of the FDL through ongoing training and collaboration, improved disease monitoring and response strategies can be developed. The integration of these findings into hatchery operations and broader conservation strategies may help address emerging risks and ultimately support salmon stock sustainability.","Table 1.

We found evidence of high sockeye salmon mortality rates; however, the majority of mortality was associated with salmon sharks, not SSL. The SSL predation that did occur was concentrated in Queen Charlotte Strait, not the largest rookery at Triangle Island. While SSL diet results are pending, SSL tagging data demonstrated evidence of restricted foraging during the initial portion of sockeye salmon migration (as animals are tied to breeding/pupping rookery) followed by rapid dispersal (particularly by males) away from Triangle Island and diverse foraging strategies among individuals. Widespread overlap of the SSL stock with migrating Fraser River sockeye salmon appears to be less than presumed.
Collectively, these results suggest sockeye salmon may be vulnerable to a broader range of predators than previously considered, and that predator communities, and predation risk, vary through space and time. Thus, previous estimates of SSL consumption rates may be biased high.",,"We used multiple methods to evaluate SSL foraging ecology, quantify sockeye salmon mortality rates, and ultimately draw inference on the likely impact of SSLs on migrating Fraser River sockeye salmon. The following activities occurred during the 2024 and 2025 field seasons (Figure 1).

Sockeye Salmon Methods
Sockeye salmon were captured aboard a charter purse seine vessel from sites near Rennell Sound (west coast Haida Gwaii; 2024 and 2025) and Queen Charlotte Strait (2025 only). Sockeye salmon were landed and transferred to a flow through seawater trough where biological data, including genetic stock identification (GSI) samples, were collected. Individuals in good physical condition were tagged with either an acoustic or satellite tag before being immediately released. We deployed acoustic transmitters on sockeye salmon (n=625) which allowed individuals to be detected on moored receiver arrays near Haida Gwaii, Triangle Island, Queen Charlotte Strait, throughout the Salish Sea, and the lower Fraser River. The acoustic receiver network included approximately 40 receivers deployed by DFO throughout coastal British Columbia, as well as infrastructure maintained by NOAA, the Ocean Tracking Network, Kintama, and the University of British Columbia. Detections data will be used to parameterize mark-recapture models to estimate survival rates along the migration corridor and identify hotspots of mortality. We also deployed popup archival satellite tags (PSATs) on a smaller number of sockeye salmon (n=35). After releasing from the animal these tags transmit light, temperature, and pressure sensor data that can be used to identify predator taxa (Seitz et al. 2019).

Sockeye Salmon Findings
GSI results are currently only available for the 2024 field season; however, the majority (>98%) of tagged sockeye salmon were identified as belonging to Fraser River populations with Chilko Lake being the dominant conservation unit (~55% of all samples). Only a subset of detections data are currently available for 2025; however preliminary results in both years (Figure 2) indicate overall survival from Haida Gwaii to the Fraser River was poor (<8%). ~50% of individuals tagged at northern sites were detected on Haida Gwaii arrays; however, mark-recapture models that account for imperfect detection probability on these arrays are required for robust estimates of survival. Survival to the Fraser River of tags deployed in Queen Charlotte Strait was markedly higher (~40%). 2% of tags were detected in the study area after deployments were completed, suggesting short-term mortality due to tagging or handling was minimal. Only two tags were detected at Triangle Island (both in 2025), however 46 tags were detected in 2025 at sea lion haul outs throughout Queen Charlotte Strait. Importantly, additional analysis is required to determine how many of these fish were likely consumed by pinnipeds based on subsequent detections. No fish were reported as intercepted by fisheries in 2024, but 5% of tagged fish were recaptured by marine and in-river fisheries and reported in 2025.

We deployed 18 PSATs at Haida Gwaii sites in 2024 and 17 in 2025 (ten in Haida Gwaii and seven in Queen Charlotte Strait). Six of the 2024 PSATs failed to report due to engineering issues. All of the remaining 12 reported before their programmed release data, suggesting the fish were predated. Of the confirmed mortalities, three could not be classified because the tag was not ingested, one was consumed by a benthic ectotherm, and eight were consumed by salmon sharks (Figure 3). In 2025, all PSATs reported and five survived to release, all from the Queen Charlotte Strait study area. Of the ten Haida Gwaii tags, four were consumed by blue sharks, three by a benthic ectotherm, and three by salmon sharks. Neither of the two Queen Charlotte Strait mortalities could be classified (Figure 3).

SSL Methods
We deployed satellite tags (paired head-mounted splash and flipper-mounted spot tags) on adult male (n=7) and female (n=14) SSLs on Triangle Island. Animals were sedated via darting gun and tagged with the assistance of staff from the Vancouver Aquarium. Females were captured near the end of July following pupping; males were captured at the beginning of June as animals staked out territories for the breeding period. Head mounted tags were epoxied to the fur and were shed by fall during the annual moult while the flipper mounted tags should stay affixed for multiple years although tag programming and battery life will ultimately determine transmission duration. The high resolution, yet shorter deployment splash tags will allow for an understanding of foraging behaviour (location and dive profiles) and sex-specific habitat use revealing explicit spatial-temporal overlap with sockeye salmon during their migration through Queen Charlotte Sound. This distribution data is critical in evaluating the relative proportion of the SSL population that has the opportunity to predate sockeye salmon. The longer-term flipper tags (8-16 months; multi-year) will allow for multi-season information on coarse foraging patterns.

We also collected SSL diet information via biochemical tracers and scats from sites on Triangle Island, as well as key haul outs in Queen Charlotte Strait, southwest coast of Vancouver Island, and the southern Strait of Georgia. The two biochemical tracers we have focused on, fatty acid profiles and stable isotopes, provide estimates of diet composition integrated over weeks to month. The fatty acid analysis (FAA; Budget et al. 2006) will provide more discrete diet estimation (prey-specific proportions) while the stable isotope analysis (SIA; Layman et al. 2012) will be useful to discriminate feeding source (pelagic vs demersal, nearshore vs shelf vs shelf break) such that we can broadly characterize foraging behaviour beyond the satellite tagged individuals. Diets estimated from scats provide a short-term (~ 1 day) estimate requiring far more extensive, repeated sampling to capture temporal variation in diet-particularly if the objective is to capture a potential pulse of a relatively rapidly migrating prey. While we collected scats (n=1,200), there was insufficient funding provided to analyze these, let alone undertake a full-fledged sampling design for scats. These are therefore archived for potential future work and analysis focused on the integrated tracer samples. In total, ~400 sea lion biopsy samples were obtained directly from satellite tagged animals or randomly via a crossbow system. To estimate diet, over 1500 potential fish and invertebrate prey samples were obtained from various DFO research cruises.

SSL Findings
During the 5 - 6-week deployments prior to moult, female foraging was concentrated on the continental shelf (Figure 4a). In the initial weeks, animals used Triangle Island as a central place for short foraging forays. As pups inevitably grew and became more independent, there was a gradual expansion and dispersal away from Triangle east to Cook Bank and Queen Charlotte Strait and south-east to Quatsino Sound with females ultimately moving to sites both east and south of Triangle Island. During the 14 - 16-week deployments prior to moult, males demonstrated very limited foraging activity during the breeding period (Figure 4b). Subsequently by mid-July there was rapid and directed dispersal immediately post-breeding with individuals ranging as far north as southeast Alaska and south to the Washington border. Triangle was not used as major haul out outside of the breeding period for either females or males. More in-depth analysis of distribution and dive behaviour is underway to explicitly parameterize sea lion foraging effort in a spatial context and provide support for interpreting diet results.

Stable isotope and fatty acid datasets for potential prey and sea lions have been completed for 2023-2024 samples; 2025 samples are currently being processed and analyzed. Preliminary analysis of 2023-2024 SI values for known age class and sex animals suggests that males and females are exploiting different prey/habitats diverging further with age (Figure 5).","Although analyses are underway, there are several key preliminary results. We found that sockeye salmon mortality rates during adult marine migrations may be considerably higher than previously assumed (e.g. Cohen 2012). At the same time, it is clear that the predator community varies along the migratory corridor--while we found some evidence of pinniped predation in Queen Charlotte Strait that warrants additional investigation, we found no evidence of pinniped predation near Haida Gwaii where mortality rates were high and apparently driven by shark predation. Similarly, we found evidence that predation impacts likely vary among and within sea lion haul outs. Despite the large size of the Triangle Island rookery, we found a very small number of tags at this location, particularly relative to Queen Charlotte Strait haul outs.

Steller sea lion satellite tag paths highlight important nuances in foraging behaviour during the months when Fraser River sockeye salmon are available. At this time of year, mature SSL are tied to pupping, nursing and breeding with only intermittent foraging. Peak pupping typically occurs early July. Females stay with their pups fasting for 1-2 weeks after which they make short foraging trips. Females appeared to disperse from Triangle by mid-August to other haul outs around Queen Charlotte Sound and WCVI. Males had very limited movements during the breeding period. Rapid and directed dispersal immediately post breeding (mid-July) was observed. Despite the large number of animals concentrated on Triangle Island during the breeding period (coincident with sockeye salmon migration), adjacent waters do not appear to be a major feeding ground this time of year. These foraging and dispersal patterns generally run counter to blanket assumptions for SSL impacts on sockeye and will have implications for foraging models. Ongoing diet analyses will provide additional information on individual, spatial, and seasonal variability in Steller sea lion foraging.

Our results emphasize the impacts of at least three predator taxa (salmon sharks, blue sharks, Steller sea lions) on sockeye salmon warrant additional consideration. Given a potential latitudinal gradient in shark abundance (Williams et al. 2010, Proudfoot et al. 2024), population level impacts may be sensitive to where Fraser River sockeye salmon intercept the continental shelf during their return migrations. All else being equal, fish making landfall near Haida Gwaii will migrate through a longer gauntlet of predators than those making landfall in Queen Charlotte Sound, which may in turn be at greater risk than those migrating through Juan de Fuca Strait. The location of landfall is uncertain, but if it is correlated with diversion rate, as seems likely, will vary among stocks as well as among years (Grant et al. 2017). If we find evidence of year-specific differences in survival rate, consistent with expected density dependent effects on predator foraging behaviour, this will add substantial additional variability due to sockeye salmon cyclicity. In short, a fixed, average predation rate applied to all stocks is likely inappropriate. Unfortunately, using statistical models to quantify the relative impact of each taxa is not possible given a lack of abundance data for blue and salmon sharks.","Our findings highlight successful ecosystem-based management of sockeye salmon requires careful consideration of factors that are often overlooked when quantifying predator impacts. First, studies on predation impacts have focused on cetaceans and pinnipeds (Chasco et al. 2017a & b, Walters et al. 2020, Nelson et al. 2024), which have robust time series of abundance. However, the effect of pinniped impacts will be biased high if the abundance of multiple predator taxa have increased in synchrony. In this scenario, reducing cetacean or pinniped effects may simply result in the remaining predator taxa increasing in abundance. Second, bioenergetics models are commonly used to quantify the population level impact of predators (Chasco et al. 2017a & b, Walters et al. 2020); however, these methods are sensitive to assumptions about the relative contribution of different species and size classes to the diet (Nelson et al. 2021). These uncertainties are further amplified by seasonal and spatial variability in predator diets, as well as differences among individuals in foraging behaviour. Finally, the total impact on prey species is also sensitive to the proportion of the prey population that is vulnerable to predation. Our findings suggest that each of these components is highly relevant when evaluating Steller sea lion impacts on Fraser River sockeye salmon.

In particular, we suggest ongoing and future work should address the following major dimensions. Seasonal and spatial variability in Steller sea lion diets should be quantified--this work will proceed using collected biochemical tracers. Seasonal, sex-specific variability in Steller sea lion distributions should be used to estimate the relative proportion of the population that is likely to overlap spatially and temporally with migrating sockeye salmon--this work could proceed using existing satellite and overflight survey data. Steller sea lion distributions should be paired with estimates of interannual and stock-specific variability in sockeye salmon migration routes to evaluate relative risk--this work is proceeding using historical catch data, but it is currently unclear whether existing data are sufficient. Since salmon-predator interactions are highly context-dependent (Wells et al. 2025), until the above data gaps are addressed efforts to mitigate predator impacts should proceed with caution and a careful consideration of the associated uncertainties.","Figure 1.

Several high risk AIS were identified within each taxonomic group and ecoregion that could negatively impact salmon stocks throughout the Pacific Region.

Managers and other decision makers need to explicitly consider the many threats posed by AIS in management and recovery plans for all salmon stocks in Pacific Region, recognizing these threats will not be uniform.","Climate change and Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS) are leading threats to biodiversity globally. In British Columbia (BC), many salmon stocks have been assessed as at-risk by COSEWIC (Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada), but while climate change has been increasingly considered in salmon management and policy, the threat posed by AIS has largely been ignored. Further, stressors like increasing global temperatures are out of the control of regional management while AIS can be managed locally given resources and interest. By targeting those AIS most likely to have the biggest impact on salmon survival or productivity, we can improve salmon recovery by reducing the stress that these invasive species cause. AIS impacts on salmon are well documented in the US Pacific Northwest where, for example, invasive Walleye consume up to 2 million smolts a year in the Columbia River (Sanderson et al. 2009). The expansion of Northern Pike in Alaska has led to the decline of salmon productivity in some regions and all five salmon species have been classified as highly vulnerable to pike invasion in at least part of their Alaskan range (Jalbert et al. 2021). Habitat alteration can also impact salmon: Schwoerer et al. (2019) estimated the potential for $159 million annual damage to the Alaskan Sockeye salmon industry from one invasive plant species, Elodea. However, the extent and relative impact of freshwater AIS threats to salmon habitat and productivity have yet to be assessed in the Pacific Region (BC/Yukon). Here we will fill this gap by applying a novel screening level risk assessment tool to prioritize species (fish, invertebrates and plants) that have already invaded BC/Yukon, are nearby or in a known vector/pathway. By using freshwater ecoregions we are able to characterize the general risk of these species both now and in the future at a scale suitable to many management and policy venues.

Information generated via this project will have tremendous utility to those managers, First Nations, and stakeholders being impacted by AIS both now and in the future. As the freshwater assessments wrap up our intent is to reach out to various groups to convey the risk of the many species assessed here and to work with them on management or control plans based on their needs.","The Non-Indigenous Species Screening Tool (NISST, Wilcox et al. 2025), was developed in collaboration with this PSSI project to fill gaps and address common limitations in previous tools for screening potentially invasive species. It is organized into three separate modules examining steps in the invasion process combined with both ecological and socioeconomic impacts. This tool provides a semiquantitative valuation of risk which explicitly incorporates uncertainty into the score (using a novel Monte Carlo method) and recognizing the increasing importance of considering climate change when assessing invasion risk, this tool also incorporates a modifier for this. From the global species pool we identified >3200 species (including fish, invertebrates and plants) that could become AIS in the Pacific Region and potentially impact salmon. From this master list, we identified 515 to be screened using NISST; with most having some history of invasiveness, being associated with a known invasion vector (e.g., organisms in trade, aquaculture, shipping, etc.), and/or having some climate match to the five freshwater ecoregions that have boundaries within the Pacific Region (British Columbia and Yukon) (Figure 1). This included 245 fish, 83 invertebrates, and 180 plants. This project will produce a ranked list of priority AIS by ecoregion, including arrows to indicate the change in risk under a future climate and a measure of uncertainty using error bars, for both species that have already invaded or have yet to invade. Further, it is possible to produce bi-plots showing the relative contribution of Invasion Potential vs. Ecological Impacts or Socioeconomic Impacts both now and in the future.

The resulting ranked list of AIS by freshwater ecoregion showing taxonomic identity of the invader (fish, invertebrate or plant), its invasion status (present vs not yet detected), the effect of climate change and uncertainty. Additional project data will identify key vectors and pathways (i.e., recreational boating, natural dispersal, organisms in trade, etc.), and AIS-specific impacts to freshwater ecosystems and salmon stocks specifically. The identification of higher risk AIS is essential to refine other PSSI-related assessments of the multiple, often interacting threats to various Pacific salmon stocks and can be used in management plans, recovery assessments, or policy documents. For example, such information can be used to refine estimates of salmon mortality, recovery or productivity thus improving fisheries management advice for salmon. Further, the ranked list of AIS generated through these assessments will inform AIS monitoring and early detection programs both within DFO (AIS NCP), the Province of British Columbia (BC MOE) and the Yukon. Finally, higher risk species can be considered in future amendments to the AIS Regulation in the Fisheries Act and vectors and pathways common among higher risk AIS can be prioritized for policy and regulatory action.

To highlight key NISST outputs we include here working examples of the modular bi-plot outputs (Figure 2) and total risk scores (Figure 3) for some of the higher risk and lower risk fish species assessed for the Alaska and Canada Pacific Coastal ecoregion (FEOW 103 in Figure 1). Please note that there were 245 fish AIS to be assessed with NISST so the final products are likely to differ and these figures are included to illustrate what can be expected at the end of this project. As expected the range of scores obtained for species that are known to be introduced to this ecoregion and those not yet known were comparable across modules (Figure 2) and total risk scores (Figure 3) using two independent assessors. Further, the inclusion of climate change to the scores for each module typically increased the scores (Figures 2 and 3) although the magnitude varied by species.

Although work is ongoing to finalize the highest risk species for each of BC's five freshwater ecoregions and specific ranks are subject to change, there are notable differences between northern and southern ecoregions with southern ones (103 and 120) having more AIS present including well known invaders such as brown bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus), goldfish (Carassius auratus), common carp (Cyprinus carpio), and rosy red minnow (Pimephales promelas). Further, there are higher risk AIS belonging to other taxa such as plants like Brazilian elodea (Egeria densa), purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria), curled pondweed (Potamogeton crispus), and invertebrates like Asian clam (Corbicula fluminea) and Chinese mystery snail (Cipangopaludina chinensis). When complete it will be possible to consider risk not only at the ecoregion level but across taxonomic groups and invasion status.

Among some of the highest-ranking fish species, common carp and goldfish are known to be environmental generalists, able to survive in a wide range of habitats. Goldfish (Carassius auratus) in particular are also widely available in the aquarium trade and thus their potential (illegal) release is an ongoing concern (Chan et al. 2019). Their ability to consume plant and animals, including eggs, makes them a potential threat to most aquatic organisms at some life stage, and their feeding activities can cause increased turbidity and disruption of aquatic plants, modifying the habitat (i.e., ecosystem engineers) resulting in both ecological and socioeconomic impacts (e.g., Deacon et al. 1964; Moyle 1976; Richardson et al. 1995; Miller and Beckman, 1996; Egertson and Downing, 2004; Weber and Brown, 2009, Jackson et al., 2010). They also carry an extensive number of diseases and parasites with the potential to impact native fish (e.g. Gilad et al., 2004; Poelen et al., 2014).

Another group of higher risk species include some catfish species. For example, channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) can spread rapidly due to a high reproductive rate and wide environmental tolerances (Jones et al., 1978). In the Columbia River they consume large numbers of juvenile salmon (Vigg et al. 1991; Sanderson et al. 2009) and predate on fish such as perch, shad, sunfish, razorback suckers, chubs, and endangered frogs (e.g. Robinette and Knight, 1981; Lentsch et al., 1996; Marsh and Douglas, 1997). Similarly, brown bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus) negatively impact native fish via predation of eggs and competition with species such as endemic sticklebacks (Gasterosteus spp.) on Vancouver Island (Dextrase and Mandrak 2006), brassy minnows (Hybognathus hankinsoni) in the Fraser River (Nowosad and Taylor, 2013), and cisco, herring and lake trout in other parts of Canada (Scott and Crossman, 1973). In addition, they serve as vectors for finfish diseases such as viral haemorrhagic septicaemia (Faisal et al., 2012).

Perhaps not surprisingly most of the lowest risk species had poor climate match to Pacific Region ecosystems, were not known to be invasive elsewhere or possess traits known to facilitate invasion, and lacked documented ecological and socioeconomic impacts. Although several are expected to benefit from a future climate, in most cases they are still not expected to become problematic. Almost half of these species were aquarium fish (116/245) representing both temperate organisms like weatherfish or tropical ones like danios and many (133/245) are known to be in trade in Canada.","It has been recognized for some time that AIS are a significant ecosystem stressor, especially in freshwater ecosystems (Sala et al. 2000), but also that ecosystem impacts can be highly context-dependent. This project is the first to comprehensively prioritize AIS for five freshwater ecoregions in Pacific Region both now and under future climate scenarios to improve management and policy decisions by explicitly considering higher risk AIS at multiple levels of decision making. NISST does not specify thresholds for high, medium or low risk species but rather allows flexibility for management to set these to ensure they are fit-for-purpose. For example, different thresholds might be set for different ecoregions depending on external factors such as salmon conservation units.

Salmon management should more explicitly consider the risks of AIS (and likely other stressors) in the development of truly integrated management plans and Species-at-Risk recovery documents. By recognizing the threat posed by AIS managers can prioritize locations where preventing introductions or spread are a priority and can develop early detection programs for the highest risk species. In locations where AIS might already exist preventing spread or mitigating impacts, especially those on at-risk species, could help preserve ecosystem structure and function, including many salmon stocks. Finally, our project identified that several AIS will benefit from climate change and impacts are expected to increase. Accounting for these types of interactions and cumulative effects could improve management and policy outcomes.

Downscaling the ecoregion risk assessments may be necessary for specific waterbodies in BC to improve salmon or ecosystem management decisions and outcomes. The goal of screening level assessments like NISST is that they provide a relatively rapid characterization of risk for relatively similar areas (here ecoregions) but they are not intended to provide a detailed assessment for any specific waterbody/location within the assessment area. Here detailed risk assessments could be undertaken or screening assessments in conjunction with additional information/data could be used.

Finally, it should be recognized that there was considerable data/information gathered for both the species being assessed and the assessment area in this process (see databases in development above). This information can be used in many decision making processes beyond the screening assessments themselves. For example, this information can be used by managers when developing early detection networks, rapid response, control or management plans for specific AIS, or recovery plans for at-risk species or areas being impacted by AIS. Further, this information can serve as a starting point for additional assessments beyond the Pacific Region as critical information will remain the same and can be used for assessment elsewhere in Canada or beyond.","AIS are not confined to freshwater ecosystems, given salmon life cycles they are likely to encounter additional high risk AIS in estuarine and marine ecosystems. Work is currently underway to identifying these higher risk AIS (fish, inverts, plants and algae) as well.

This project has identified higher risk AIS using a new screening tool such that results are standardized and can be used to inform potential regulatory amendments to the Aquatic Invasive Species Regulations in the Fisheries Act. A large number of higher risk AIS are not yet known from Pacific Region so listing could facilitate proactive measures to keep these species out or have early detection/surveillance and rapid response plans in place should they arrive.

Identifying and responding to AIS is a shared responsibility so communication products are needed to raise awareness among First Nations, stakeholders, and the public about the risks AIS pose to BC ecosystems, including salmon. This should include where to report suspicious species so the proper management actions can be undertaken (and responses are for AIS and not similar looking native species).","Figure 1. Map of the five freshwater ecoregions of the world (FEOW) that overlap with the Pacific Region. These ecoregions include the Upper Yukon FEOW (102), the Alaska and Canada Pacific Coast FEOW (103), the Upper Mackenzie FEOW (104), the Lower Mackenzie FEOW (105) and the Columbia Glaciated FEOW (120).

Overall, findings suggest that OA and, to a lesser degree elevated seawater temperatures, may result in altered fatty acid composition in pteropods, potentially leading to shifts in nutritional quality and associated impacts on trophic energy transfer. Additionally, results indicate that temperature stress could pose more immediate threat to pteropod survival.

We propose that any changes in the nutritive status of L. helicina under climate stressor conditions could have carry-over impacts to juvenile salmon growth, health, and survival. However, we highlight that this study represents preliminary findings only and future research is needed to assess multi-trophic impacts.","Under global climate change, co-occurrence of gradual physical changes in seawater and extreme events pose a substantial threat to marine ecosystems (IPCC, 2023). This PSSI-funded project focused on the Strait of Georgia (SOG) within the Northeast Pacific coastal region where steady rises in mean seasonal seawater temperatures and pCO2 levels, and increasingly prevalent acute stressor events such as heatwaves and low-pH upwellings, are already occurring (Bylhouwer et al., 2013; Evans et al., 2019; Okey et al., 2024; Raymond et al., 2022; Talloni-Alvarez et al., 2014). Moreover, the SOG is distinctive as conditions of high pCO2 and aragonite undersaturation persist year-round across a wide extent of the water column (Moore-Maley et al., 2016; Simpson et al., 2024). Limacina helicina, a cold-water pteropod well-represented within the region's zooplankton communities, is highly susceptible to climate change stressors, with documented impacts of ocean warming and ocean acidification (OA) on shell development, growth, and survival (Bednaršek et al., 2016, 2022; Lischka et al., 2022; Lischka & Riebesell, 2012). However, there has been minimal investigation of climate change effects on the species' nutritional status (e.g. fatty acid (FA) composition) under regionally-relevant conditions. Given the importance of L. helicina as a dietary item for some populations of juvenile Pacific salmon species in the Northeast Pacific (Brodeur et al., 2007; Doubleday & Hopcroft, 2015; Sturdevant et al., 2012), it was proposed that any change in the nutritive status of L. helicina under climate stressor conditions could have carry-over impacts to juvenile salmon growth, health, and survival.

The project involved cross-program collaboration between DFO researchers based at the Pacific Biological Station (PBS) and the Pacific Science Enterprise Centre (PSEC) for investigation of the impacts of warming and OA conditions (representative of future conditions in the SOG) on FA profiles of L. helicina populations in the region. Limacina helicina samples were collected and processed as part of juvenile Pacific salmon survey fieldwork carried out in the SOG during 2014−2023 by the Salmon Marine Interactions Program at PBS (Lead: Neville). The program also supported live collection (within the SOG) of L. helicina for a climate change experiment (2023). Subsequent field sample sorting (i.e. extraction of whole pteropods from historical size-fractionated plankton samples) and laboratory experimentation (i.e. conducting of a climate change experiment in the Fisheries and Oceans Climate Change and Ocean Acidification Laboratory (FOCCOAL)), and nutritional analyses (i.e. FA analyses via gas chromatography) were carried out by the Sustainable Invertebrate Aquaculture Program at PBS (Lead: Pearce) and Nutrition Program at PSEC (Lead: Forster), respectively.","Climate Change Experiment: Live L. helicina (Figure 1) were collected from the SOG in early October 2023 for use in a climate stressor experiment. Collection of approximately 800 pteropods was carried out over a 7-h period across a centrally-located area of the SOG via a series of vertical tows (N=9) using a bongo net collar assembly with two 58-cm diameter Nitex nets (253-µm mesh) deployed to a maximum depth of 300 m. Following, jars with animals were kept in a temperature-controlled cool box (~12°C, dark conditions). Within 24 h of collection, all pteropods were transported to the FOCCOAL at PBS for application to a climate change experiment. A full factorial design was applied to the experiment, resulting in four treatments: Control, OA, Warming, OA+Warming (n=6 tanks per treatment). Treatment conditions were achieved via use of the FOCCOAL, which employs a programmable logic controller and automated seawater and gas mixing systems to tightly control seawater temperature and pCO2, respectively. Pteropods were exposed to singular and coinciding warming (mean summer seawater temperature + 4°C) and OA (Ωaragonite < 1) conditions, with subsequent FA analyses carried out on 48-h and 5-d timepoint samples via gas chromatography (at PSEC). Results indicated a significant impact of OA on nutritional status at 48 h (Figure 2) and a significant impact of temperature on survival at 5 d (Figure 3).

Time-series Analyses (Field Samples):
Additionally, FA analyses of L. helicina picked from historical plankton samples collected in the SOG as part of juvenile Pacific salmon survey work (Neville et al., 2025, 2026a, 2026b, 2026c, 2026d, 2026e; Neville & Spencer, 2026) were carried out to examine time-series changes in FA profiles in relation to regional temperature records (e.g. DFO British Columbia Shore Station Oceanographic Program, Chrome Island Lightstation temperature dataset). A subset (N=35) of frozen 1-mm size-fractioned samples covering a 10-year time series (2014-2023) were compiled to carry out pteropod FA profiling. Within a given year (N=7), five sampling stations were selected according to target tow depth and location. Sub-samples of the 1-mm size class samples from each station were used to obtain whole pteropods for FA analyses. FA analyses was carried out at PSEC via gas chromatography with results indicating significant differences in a number of fractions between year groups and in the overall FA profiles of a number of year groups (2016 and 2019; 2018 and 2021) (Figure 4), the latter findings parallelled by minor to moderate divergences in seasonal temperature conditions.",Project data may be fed into predictive habitat distribution modelling and climate change vulnerability assessments for Pacific salmon species (e.g. ACCASP's Fish Stock Climate Vulnerability Assessment Tool (FSCVAT)). This would enable environmental/aquaculture managers and decision-makers to prepare for and respond to the impacts of climate change.,"Findings here provide preliminary evidence that L. helicina of the SOG region may tolerate persistent OA conditions with minimal impact to survival, but potentially at the expense of energy stores. Moreover, declining aragonite saturation state across the area could pose further detriment to their role as a food source to upper trophic species. In addition, we propose that temperature stress could pose more immediate threat to survival, particularly if warming in upper surface layers extends throughout the wider water column. Results highlight the need for improved understanding of ecological interactions under climate change conditions with regard to food-web dynamics, and the importance of considering multiple stressors when determining vulnerability of L. helicina to future climate change conditions. Recommendations for future studies include the development of larger experimental mesocosms for improved pteropod holding facilities and extension of experimental time lines to encompass longer-term exposure periods. The current work could also be followed-up with laboratory-based salmon feeding trials to determine whether (and to what extent) impacts to pteropods relay to juvenile salmon growth/health (e.g. multi-trophic impacts).","Figure 1.

Clayoquot Sound","WCVI Chinook, Coho",,First marine year,West Coast Vancouver Island,,,,"The main idea of the project:
To apply a combination of monthly plankton biomass, taxonomy, and oceanographic measurements to enhance understanding and characterize: 1) the variability of zooplankton prey availability for first year ocean phase WCVI Chinook; 2) the variability of prey quality; and 3) the potential for predator-prey match-mismatch events (euphausiid phenology). This study also placed a focus on seasonal and interannual availability of the lipid-rich, northern shelf euphausiid, Thysanoessa spinifera.

Key findings:
The amount and annual timing of zooplankton groups common to juvenile Chinook diets followed similar seasonal patterns in both Barkley and Clayoquot Sounds; however, the mean biomass of dominant groups, Calanoid copepods, euphausiids, and decapod larvae was greater in Clayoquot relative to Barkley Sound.
Recruitment to and subsequent development of T. spinifera juvenile stages was sufficiently resolved by monthly sampling in Barkley Sound to estimate cohort development and peak abundance timing.
The mean annual timing of peak T. spinifera abundance was June 12th and interannual timing of peak abundance varied widely (60 day range) between project years (2022-2025)
The long term annual biomass anomaly time series (1991-2013,2022-2025) of Barkley Sound T. spinifera was highly variable with correspondence to both winter sea surface temperature anomalies and Robertson Creek Hatchery two-year old survival indicator.

Implications of these findings for salmon and decision-makers:
This project was one of multiple 'Follow the fish' (FtF) projects which sought to identify key biological and environmental factors limiting productivity and survival of natural origin WCVI Chinook. Results of this PSSI project demonstrate that long-term, monthly-resolved, prey (zooplankton) monitoring provides valuable prey availability information relevant to early marine survival of juvenile Chinook and can be used to support annual stock assessment model forecast evaluation.","A Marine Risk Assessment for natural-origin WCVI Chinook (Irvine et al. 2024) was carried out on the basis of expert and community engagement via a series of public workshops convened in 2022. A suite of key limiting factors (LF) focused on all life history stages were assessed and ranked according to current and future risk. Three LFs, prey quality (LF12), prey abundance (LF13), and mis-match with prey (L14) were identified with 'high', 'high', and 'moderate' current risk during first marine year when zooplankton are important to diet. Future risk was elevated for each LF to 'very high', 'very high', and 'high', respectively. This project revived a long-term DFO zooplankton time series (1991-2013) in Barkley Sound and established baseline knowledge for zooplankton in Clayoquot Sound through monthly sampling during the FtF period.

We were focused on identifying the current status of the northern shelf euphausiid, Thysanoessa spinifera, a lipid rich euphausiid (Fisher et al. 2020), prominent in the diets of multiple salmonids in Barkley Sound (Tanasichuk 1998, Summers 2003) and the Northeast Pacific more broadly (Feinberg and Peterson 2003; Shaw et al. 2013). This project was designed to fill a sampling gap and take advantage of relatively high frequency surveys in two important foraging areas for WCVI juvenile Chinook and characterize current status of and assess prey availability, prey quality, and euphausiid peak timing (LFs 12-14). The project collaborates and supports research with partners at the University of Victoria, University of British Columbia, Bamfield Marine Sciences Center, Ha'oom Fisheries Society and internal DFO partners including those participating in the 'Follow the Fish' (PSSI) project.","Sampling stations in Clayoquot Sound and Barkley Sound are identified in Figure 1. Logistical constraints necessitated different sampling approaches for both areas. In Clayoquot Sound, zooplankton were sampled with a 200 mm mesh, 50 cm ring net towed vertically from near bottom to the surface at ~ 1 m s-1. Core sampling stations were initially chosen in alignment with micro trolling surveys and were moved in 2025 to stations identified by red symbols in Figure 1. Additional stations were also sampled on an opportunistic basis. In Barkley Sound, we sought to reproduce field methods of Summers (1993) and Tanasichuk (1998). Briefly, 350 mm mesh, 60 cm mouth diameter Bongo nets, were towed obliquely from near bottom to surface. Ascent rate of the net was ~ 1 m s-1 as the ship moved < 2 knots. Zooplankton were sampled after sunset at four Barkley Sound stations: Coaster, Swale, Robbers, and Mackenzie. Net contents were concentrated and preserved in 10% sodium-borate formalin-seawater solution. In 2022, the contents of the other Bongo net were preserved in 95% ethanol for molecular analysis and then at Robbers station 2023-2025). Staring in 2023, net content on the other side were froze and later size fractionated, freeze dried, massed and prepared for protein, total lipid, and energy content measurement. We are midway through this sample processing. Full water column properties were measured with a Seabird 19+ CTD at Sarita and Swale until September 2023 and then at all stations for subsequent surveys. Discrete seawater samples were collected for nutrients, phytoplankton taxonomy, and chlorophyll a (phytoplankton biomass) at all five stations. Surface- and deep salinity and nutrients were also sampled at Sarita and Swale stations.

Zooplankton samples were enumerated by taxonomists based at the Plankton Ecology laboratory, Institute of Ocean Sciences, Sidney, BC, according to Mackas (1992) and Lu et al. (2003). All taxonomic enumeration was resolved to species and stage where possible. For comparing biomass in both Sounds, we focused on the coarse taxonomic categories used for prey identification in stomach contents of juvenile Chinook. The biomass of calanoid copepods and euphausiids dominated in both Clayoquot and Barkley Sound during FtF project years. Peak timing of calanoid copepods was spring and late-summer/autumn for euphausiids in both areas (Figure 2). Decapod larvae biomass followed calanoid copepods and euphausiids. The biomass of these three groups was greater on average in Clayoquot relative to Barkley Sound, whereas, Amphipod biomass was greater in Barkley relative to Clayoquot Sound.

Juvenile and adult euphausiids were measured to the nearest millimeter (total body length) using a stage micrometer. Body length and stage were used for cohort visualization (Figure 3.) and timing estimates. The timing of peak T. spinifera abundance was estimated from the regression of cumulative abundance of 5-9 mm juveniles against day of year, where date of maximum abundance corresponded to 50% of maximum cumulative abundance. Interannual variability of peak timing was high (Figure 3.) Peak timing in 2022 was estimated to occur late on July 20th versus early timings of May 20th and June 1st in 2023 and 2024. Timing in 2025 was June 9th and close to the four year mean date, June 12th. The long term time series of T. spinifera population biomass (Figure 4.) in Barkley Sound, La Perouse banks, and the Northern Vancouver Island shelf tended to covary. A similar pattern for Euphausia pacifica was not evident. The survival of two year old RCH Chinook was significantly correlated (p <0.05) with the Barkley Sound T. spinifera population, however, additional analysis suggests that this is not a causal relationship but likely a common response to an unmeasured environmental factor. Similar relationships were found for T. spinifera La Perouse Banks and NVI populations; however, they were weaker and non-significant, suggesting the importance local conditions.","This project provides detailed environmental information including prey availability for a WCVI Chinook salmon life history stage, first marine year, particularly vulnerable to mortality (Irvine et al. 2024). Data collected for this project provides monthly resolved, taxonomically detailed, census of the zooplankton assemblages in two WCVI Chinook foraging grounds, Barkley and Clayoquot Sounds. This type of monitoring is necessary for developing an understanding of what drives variability of the prey (zooplankton) field encountered by juvenile Chinook; and provides important life stage information supporting evaluation of stock assessment forecasts by salmon managers. This program provides the basis for a deeper insight into how variation of physical conditions (e.g. temperature) influence year to year changes in the timing of a key prey species, Thysanoessa spinifera. The method applied here may be applicable to other prey groups but may also provide added information for release timing strategies.","This PSSI funded project provided the basis for demonstrating that routine monthly-resolved sampling in Barkley and Clayoquot Sounds is suitable for capturing variation of zooplankton composition, biomass, and food quality, at scales relevant to the first marine year for WCVI juvenile Chinook. Monitoring in both areas either contributed to the start or revival of 'prey' monitoring programs. The utility of the preliminary results presented here makes a good case for maintaining focused plankton monitoring in Clayoquot and Barkley Sounds, but also establishing similar programs in other foraging areas along the WCVI.","Figure 1.

juvenile WCVI Chinook salmon are exposed to and take up harmful algal biotoxins in Barkley Sound.
biotoxins known to harm fish peak in summer/fall in Barkley Sound in both water and fish tissues.
results suggest that biotoxin exposure/impacts can be mitigated e.g. via timing of hatchery releases.","Biotoxins produced by harmful algae are know to cause illness and mortality in marine animals including juvenile fish (Lefebvre et al., 2005). Regular monitoring of harmful algal biotoxins in B.C. coastal waters since 2020 (Ross et al., 2025b) has revealed significant correlations between climate variables (e.g. water temperature) and the concentrations of these toxins in areas known to be frequented by Pacific salmon. These include at-risk WCVI Chinook salmon populations, for which harmful algae were identified as an emerging threat during the WCVI Chinook Rebuilding Plan Marine Risk Assessment (MRA) Workshop #3 held in April 2022. However, the levels of harmful algal biotoxins to which juvenile WCVI Chinook salmon are exposed in critical habitats such as Barkley and Clayoquot Sounds are unknown. This is an important knowledge gap, given that low early marine survival is contributing to declines in WCVI Chinook and other Pacific salmon populations.

The goal of this PSSI 'Follow the Fish' project was to build upon our Biotoxin Monitoring Program (Ross and Mueller, 2024) by adapting established analytical methods and procedures to measure harmful algal biotoxins in juvenile WCVI Chinook salmon tissues (gill, liver) and habitat (Barkley Sound) using samples collected by 'Follow the Fish' krill and salmon survey teams, in partnership with local First Nations. This information is being combined with environmental data (water properties, eDNA), assessments of fish health and condition (biometrics, gene expression), and information on life history (otolith microchemistry) to help forecast and potentially mitigate early marine exposure of WCVI Chinook salmon to harmful algal biotoxins, and associated impacts on their health and survival.","Harmful algal biotoxins were measured in sea water using the method developed for our Marine Biotoxin Monitoring Program (Ross and Mueller, 2024). Surface sea water was collected at 5 locations in Barkley Sound (Fig. 1) during krill surveys carried out at the beginning of each month and filtered on board to obtain filter and filtrate samples, from which biotoxins were extracted and analyzed by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry to obtain dissolved and particulate biotoxin concentrations (Ross et al., 2025a). These were combined to obtain monthly values of total biotoxin concentration at each location (Fig. 2). To assess exposure to harmful algal biotoxins, juvenile WCVI Chinook salmon captured by purse seining close to krill survey locations were dissected to obtain gill and liver tissue samples, which were pooled as necessary to obtain sufficient material for analysis.

Products and tools developed during this project include a Regional Biotoxin Database (in progress) for organizing, storing and retrieving biotoxin and related environmental, biological, and taxonomic information for sea water and biological samples collected during this project (and the Marine Biotoxin Monitoring Program) with the goal of making it available to co-workers via DMApps.

Advances in methodology during this project include procedures to minimize cross-contamination while dissecting and pooling of tissues for biotoxin analysis, and adaptation of the method for sea water analysis to measure harmful algal biotoxins in very small amounts of tissue, thereby allowing them to be studied in individual fish, organs and/or early life stages (Mueller et al., in preparation).

Examples of communication and knowledge transfer include a Newsletter (Ross and Loseto, 2025) that describes the monitoring of biotoxins and contaminants during the PSSI 'Follow the Fish' project. Results from the monitoring of biotoxins in Barkley Sound during fall 2023 were also included in a report prepared for Snuneymuxw First Nation (Ross, 2024) on the measurement of harmful algal biotoxins near Nanaimo at the same time, to provide context for the interpretation of those results. Knowledge about seasonal trends in biotoxin concentration obtained during this project, and how it can be used to mitigate risks associated with biotoxin exposure in juvenile salmon through the timing of hatchery releases, was presented during a Fish Health & Hatchery Biology Seminar (Ross, 2025).

Key results include:
detection and identification of seasonal patterns in the concentrations of harmful algal biotoxins in Barkley Sound, including those know to be harmful to juvenile fish (Fig. 2).
detection of certain biotoxins in the tissues of juvenile WCVI Chinook salmon present in Barkley Sound when those biotoxins are relatively abundant in the surrounding water (June to September).
recognition that WCVI Chinook are being exposed to harmful algal biotoxins in their critical habitat during early marine life stages, at levels sufficient to cause uptake in gill and liver tissues (Fig. 3).","This project has revealed that juvenile WCVI Chinook salmon present in Barkley Sound during late summer are exposed to harmful algal biotoxins at levels sufficient to cause uptake in their tissues.

biotoxins present in Barkley Sound follow seasonal trends similar to those observed elsewhere in B.C. coastal waters (Fig. 2).
juvenile WCVI Chinook salmon in Barkley Sound are exposed to increasing levels of algal biotoxins from May onwards, particularly at central and outer locations (Coaster, Swale, Mackenzie: Fig. 1).
exposure of juvenile WCVI Chinook salmon to biotoxins is confirmed by detection of domoic acid, yessotoxin, and the paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxin saxitoxin in gill and/or liver tissue from purse seined fish caught in Barkley Sound in late summer 2023 and/or 2024.
levels of biotoxins detected in tissues seem to correlate with those in the surrounding water (Fig. 3).

Results from our Marine Biotoxin Monitoring Program suggest that certain biotoxins including those harmful to juvenile fish are trending upwards in B.C. coastal waters, and that higher biotoxin levels may be associated with climate-related factors such as increasing temperature and/or nutrient limitation due to stratification caused by higher temperatures or freshwater inputs (Ross at al., 2025).

Tools are being developed (CSRF project 2025-26-11-07) to predict future levels of biotoxin exposure and uptake based upon linkages with environmental conditions measured at the same time. This will allow DFO to forecast and potentially mitigate levels and impacts of biotoxin exposure in WCVI Chinook; for example, by timing the release of hatchery fish to minimize exposure (Ross, 2025).

Meanwhile, gene expression analysis is being carried out (Art Bass et al.) to see whether observed levels of biotoxin exposure result in stress responses, biological effects and/or health impacts in juvenile salmon, thereby helping to identify biologically significant thresholds of exposure for these limiting factors.

We are working with the Contaminants group (Lisa Loseto et al.) to investigate the separate and cumulative effects of biotoxins and contaminants on juvenile WCVI Chinook salmon, taking advantage of the observed seasonal trends in biotoxin exposure.


We are also working with the Otolith Microchemistry group (Nicole LaForge, Micah Quindazzi) to relate biotoxin exposure and impacts to life stage and history (e.g. estuary residence time, age at entry) for specific populations (Sarita, Robertson), and with the eDNA group (Christoph Deeg et al.) on interactions of juvenile WCVI Chinook salmon with harmful algae and other marine species.

In addition to providing total biotoxin concentrations, the analysis of filter and filtrate samples (Ross et al., 2025a) allows us to compare biotoxin levels in different salmon tissues with dissolved and particulate biotoxin concentrations in the surrounding water, and to see if the data support a particular pathway of exposure (e.g. uptake via ingestion would likely give a better correlation with particulate biotoxins whereas uptake via gills would likely correlate better with dissolved biotoxins).

The analytical tools used in this project (e.g. high performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry) provide a high degree of confidence in the measured concentrations of harmful algal biotoxins in sea water and fish tissues. However, the west coast of Vancouver Island is a highly dynamic environment while the lifecycles of anadromous fish like WCVI Chinook salmon extend beyond the 3-year timeframe of this PSSI project. Consequently, more data is needed to confirm our initial findings. Ideally, this would involve the collection and analysis of samples and data for at least another 2 years, work that is current planned for the CSRF Project ""Linking climate variables to algal biotoxin production and impacts on Pacific salmon"" (2025-26-11-07) which runs until March 31, 2028.","Remaining knowledge gaps include additional monitoring data with which to establish longer-term trends in biotoxin production in Barkley Sound and how these may relate to climate change. They also include future data on adult returns and indicators of health, recruitment, etc. for salmon that were exposed to the observed concentrations of biotoxins in Barkley Sound during this project (i.e. from July 2023 to November 2025). This will allow long-term risks associated with 'carry forward' impacts of biotoxin exposure to be assessed, along with any early marine life stage impacts revealed by gene expression analysis and/or biometric indicators of fish health in juvenile salmon during this project.

Meanwhile, the findings of this project can be operationalized by incorporating information on the temporal and spatial distributions of harmful algal biotoxins in Barkley Sound (Figs. 1 and 2) into the scheduling of hatchery releases for different populations (Sarita, Robertston) based on knowledge of their migration behaviour (incl. salt water entry and estuarine residence times) to minimize biotoxin exposure and impacts in juvenile salmon. The observed relationships between biotoxin levels in fish tissues and dissolved, particulate and/or total biotoxin concentrations (Fig. 3) in the surrounding water can also be used to help identify pathways of exposure and evaluate current and future risks posed by measured and projected biotoxin concentrations to juvenile WCVI salmon in Barkley Sound.","Figure 1.

Fish fed the transition diet did not show any apparent advantages over fish fed the control diet, in terms of smoltification (enzymatic activities of gill Na+, K+ ATPase), growth performance or survival.
We do not recommend broadscale adoption of transition diets at DFO hatcheries at this time, given that they do not appear to be an effective way to improve early marine survival.","The main objectives of salmon hatcheries in Canada are to enhance wild populations and support salmon fisheries, but are often hindered by low early marine survival of salmon after release (Beamish et al. 2010, 2012). While low early marine survival can be attributed to various factors, smoltification [the morphological, behavioural, and physiological changes salmon undergo to enable them to adjust to the marine environment (McCormick 2012; Brauner and Richards 2020)], is potentially a major bottleneck. During smoltification, one of the key changes is elevated enzyme activities of gill Na+, K+ ATPase (NKA), which plays a crucial role in facilitating primary salt secretion at the gills (McCormick 2012; Brauner and Richards 2020). Both elevated gill NKA levels (McCormick and Saunders 1987; Stich et al. 2015b, 2015a) and high survival post seawater transition (Clarke 1982) are considered valid indicators of smoltification development of salmonids.

In hatchery settings, a change in photoperiod (increasing daylength) can trigger smoltification, while temperature (warming) can accelerate its development in salmonids (Clarke et al. 1989; Muir et al. 1994; Duston and Saunders 1995; Ban 2000; Strand et al. 2018). In addition, past studies have also reported that salt supplementation in the diet could facilitate smoltification development of salmonids (positive effects: Zaugg et al. 1983; Trombetti et al. 1996; Staurnes and Finstad 2000; Hanson et al. 2016); but also negative effects see: Trombetti et al. 1996; Hanson et al. 2016). Manipulating the diet represents a feasible and relatively simple approach to further improve the smoltification success and thus early marine survival of hatchery salmon in BC. In collaboration with the DFO Salmon Enhancement Program, the objective of the present study was to investigate the impact of a seawater transition diet (Adapt Flex-transition diet vs control diet), on the smoltification, growth and survival of stream-type (ST, typically resides in freshwater for >1 year prior to migrating to the ocean) and ocean-type (OT, typically resides in freshwater for <6 months) Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha ) during the transition from freshwater to seawater.","On March 18th 2025, stream type (ST) and ocean type (OT) Chinook salmon from Chilliwack hatchery were transferred to 200 L indoor tanks (N=4 tanks per treatment, per strain) at 10°C under natural photoperiod at Pacific Science Enterprise Centre (PSEC), in West Vancouver, BC. Fish were fed control diets to satiation 3-4 times daily until the start of the experiment. The experiment started on April 2, 2025 for ST Chinook (control: 4.96 ± 0.02 g, 7.58 ± 0.01 cm; treatment: 4.87 ± 0.05 g, 7.55 ± 0.03 cm) and April 30, 2025 for OT Chinook (control: 4.29 ± 0.03 g, 7.30 ± 0.02 cm), respectively. These timings were also around 5 weeks before the time when the fish would usually be released by the hatchery to begin their outmigration. Fish (N = 55 per tank for ST, and N = 50 per fish for OT; 4 tanks per diet treatment per life stage) were fed one of two diets to satiation daily during a 5 week growth trial in freshwater: control (BioClark's Fry, 3.0 mm, Bio-Oregon, Canada) or treatment transition diet (Adapt Flex 3 mm, EWOS, Canada), which contained 5% NaCl, and additional other proprietary ingredients (e.g. an immunostimulant compound and mix of exclusive nucleotide). Fish were maintained on their treatment diets for an additional 34 days (ST) and 7 days (OT) until the seawater transition. The timing of the seawater transition was determined when the majority of the fish in experiment tanks showed visual cues of smolt transformation, specifically the development of silvering body colour, and fading of parr marks. The fish were transitioned to seawater over 1 day, and then all fish were fed the same control diet for 4 weeks, after which the experiment was terminated and all remaining fish were euthanized (TMS at 0.2 g/L).

Fish were sampled for body size (mass and fork length) and gill Na+, K+ ATPase (NKA; 5 - 8 fish per tank per sampling time, except on day 0, when total 30 fish were sampled prior to tank stocking) on: (1) day 0; (2) after 5 weeks on the experimental diets in freshwater; (3) 1 day after seawater transition; and (4) after 4 weeks in seawater. The Specific growth Rate (SGR) for each replicate tank was calculated for 2 periods: (1) the 5-week freshwater trial; (2) from the end of freshwater trial to the end of the seawater trial, using the formula below:
SGR (%) = [ln (F) - ln (I)] × 100 / T
Where I = initial mean fish weight per tank (g), F = final mean fish weight per tank (g), and T = experiment duration (days)
Enzyme activities of gill Na+ K+ ATPase (NKA) were analyzed using methods as described by Mccormick (1993).
Fish growth and gill NKA levels were analyzed using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) using Sigmaplot 14. A statistical level of 0.05 is considered significant, and all data were expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM).

Overall, there were no differences in the trends between OT and ST Chinook salmon. Survival was excellent for both ST and OT Chinook salmon throughout the entire study (>91% across Chinook strains and diet treatments; Table 1). As expected, gill NKA activity increased during the experiment, indicating that smoltification processes were progressing over time (Figure 1; significant main effect of sampling stage; ST p = 0.002; OT p<0.001). However, there were no differences in gill NKA levels between diet treatments (ST: p = 0.21; OT: p = 0.30). For growth, fish grew faster on the control diet compared to the transition diet, but only in freshwater (Figure 2; significant interaction between diet and sampling stage; ST: p < 0.001; OT: p = 0.028). In freshwater, control fish had significantly higher SGR than the treatment fish. However, in seawater, SGR were similar for both groups, when all fish were fed the same control diet. Notably, SGR levels were much lower (up to 50% reduced) in seawater compared to freshwater (Figure 2).","This study investigated the effects of a transition diet on the smoltification development, growth and survival of ST and OT Chinook salmon during the transition from freshwater to seawater with the overall goal to improve early marine life survival. Throughout the lab experiment, all fish appeared robust, as they were able to handle multiple handling and sampling events without showing obvious adverse effects such as post sampling mortalities. By the end of the study, regardless of the diet, both ST and OT Chinook salmon apparently smolted well, as indicated by the elevated Gill NKA levels after the experiment started (Fig. 1), and the high survival 24-h and 4-weeks post seawater transfer (Table 1). Moreover, the overall data trends are highly similar between ST and OT Chinook salmon, indicating that both life history types responded comparably to the diet treatment and seawater transfer.


Overall, the results of this study showed no apparent advantage of using the transition diet over the control diet in rearing Chinook salmon. First, for each strain of Chinook salmon, fish fed both the transition diet and control diet reached very similar smoltification status in terms of gill NKA activities and exhibited high survival post seawater transition. Secondly, compared to the control diet, the transition diet did not show an advantage on fish growth performance. In fact, for both ST and OT Chinook salmon, the control fish grew significantly faster in freshwater (Figure 2), and this is also in agreement with other studies (Salman and Eddy 1988; Hanson et al. 2016). In the present study, the growth differences observed may be related to the fish appetite for the feed, which was reflected by the amount of food fed to reach visual satiation. Particularly for ST Chinook salmon, the control fish consistently displayed a bigger appetite for feeding, and were thus offered more feed than the treatment fish throughout the study; this behaviour might thus translate into the observed larger body mass gains in control fish than treatment fish.

Despite high survival, transition to seawater resulted in compromised growth rates for both ST and OT Chinook salmon. While all fish were fed the same control diet in seawater, the SGR of all fish decreased to a similar rate of 1 - 1.08 % after 4 weeks in seawater (Figure 2); indeed, the SGR of control ST Chinook salmon, which was the highest in freshwater (2.11 ± 0.00% per day), had the largest reduction of almost 50%. This slower growth of Chinook salmon post seawater transfer has been reported by other studies as well (Clarke et al. 1981; Morgan and Iwama 1991). With the increased metabolic rate of Chinook salmon in increased salinity (Morgan and Iwama, 1991), the fish may thus have less net energy for supporting growth (Brauner and Richards 2020), resulting in slower SGR at this stage. While the seawater growth phase was only 4 weeks in the present study, these Chinook salmon might need more time to physiologically adjust for the seawater condition, before compensating for their growth. In a wild setting, elevated metabolic rates and incomplete smoltification processes leading to reduced SGR could contribute to early marine mortality. In this regard, sufficient estuary rearing areas could be pivotal to support smoltification processes, feeding opportunities and protection from predation during this critical transition stage (McNatt et al. 2016; Moore et al. 2016; Chalifour et al. 2021).

Interestingly, the smoltification development rates likely differed between the strains. At the start of the present study, the gill NKA levels (unit: μmol ADP·mg protein−1·h−1) of ST Chinook salmon (2.02 ± 0.26) are comparable to those reported from Chinook salmon at the beginning of river migration (mean 1.34 - 1.64; Ewing et al. 2001), while OT Chinook salmon (3.48 ± 0.22) had already reached a similar level of those caught in estuaries (3.8 ± 0.32; Ewing et al., 2001). This finding suggested that while OT Chinook salmon were held for 4 weeks longer until experiment start, they were also in more advanced smoltification development, which was also supported by fish morphology observation during initial tank stocking. After 4 weeks in seawater, the gill NKA levels of OT Chinook salmon were still higher than ST Chinook salmon (mean value of control and treatment; OT: 5.30 ± 0.24; ST: 3.78 ± 0.24); these levels are comparable to those of Chinook salmon smolt at early stage of seawater transfer at 34 ppt (mean around 4; Quinn et al. 2003), but lower than those observed after 10 days in seawater (mean: 6; Quinn et al. 2003). In fact, Houde et al. (2019) reported even higher gill NKA levels from Chinook salmon smolt both in freshwater (5.0 ± 2.5) and seawater (9.6 ± 2.8).

It is possible that the positive effects of a transition diet on smoltification were masked by other factors, such as temperature. Increasing temperature has been reported to accelerate smoltification processes, in terms of earlier elevation and higher gill NKA activities in Atlantic salmon (Solbakken et al. 1994; Mccormick and Moriyama 2000; McCormick et al. 2002), Chinook salmon (Muir et al. 1994), and sockeye salmon (Ban 2000). In the present study, all fish experienced an increase of water temperature during transfer from the hatchery (5.8 ± 0.4oC for ST, and 7.4 ± 0.2oC for OT) to PSEC (10°C). Therefore, it is possible that smoltification development had already been accelerated soon after they were introduced to the holding tanks, before the experiment started. In this case, the effects of the transition diet may have been masked, as both control and treatment fish would show accelerated smoltification development. While the initial higher gill NKA levels of OT Chinook salmon discussed above, seemed to support this hypothesis, more concrete evidence are still needed. To mitigate the potential interference of a water temperature effect, future studies could design similar experiments so that the fish would not experience a significant change in water temperature, such as running the entire study at the hatchery as reported by Hansen et al. (2016).","We found no evidence to suggest that using seawater transition diets (Adapt Flex by EWOS Canada Ltd.) will improve early marine survival for hatchery fish. The results of the present study showed that there were no apparent advantages of using this seawater transition diet over the routine control diet on rearing ST and OT Chinook salmon in terms of smoltification, growth and seawater survival. Indeed, all these performance parameters measured in the present studies showed very similar trends between ST and OT Chinook. As such, we do not recommend broadscale use of these transition diets at DFO hatcheries at this time.

On the other hand, future studies are encouraged to investigate knowledge gaps revealed here. One recommendation is to conduct a similar study in a hatchery setting, in order to have the most direct insights into how a transition diet may benefit the hatchery production of salmon at DFO. Hatchery and lab conditions vary in several aspects, including water source, fish density, temperature, and rearing environment. In the present study, it was speculated that the inevitable change in water temperature from hatchery to the lab might have accelerated the smoltification development in both control and treatment fish, thus masking the effects of transition diet. Conducting a similar study in a hatchery setting could reveal the effects of the transition diet, while eliminating similar potential interfering factors that may exist in lab environment. Moreover, while the present study focused on growth and gill NKA as traditional development indicators, future studies could further investigate dietary effects on the physiological and behavioural performance parameters relevant to survival post hatchery-release. For example, swimming or migration performance (Pedersen et al. 2008; Serrano et al. 2009; Wilson et al. 2021), standard and maximum metabolic rates (Farrell 2009; Auer et al. 2015) and predator avoidance behaviours (Olla et al. 1998; Jackson and Brown 2011) are known to be critical to salmon survival in the early marine environment. Finally, given that the transition diet does not appear to be effective at improving early marine survival, we recommend considering how alternative diets could confer other desirable traits in fish, such as the possibility that high lipid diets could reduce the jacking rate in salmon.","Table 1.

Chehalis Pink",,,"Thiamine deficiency complex (TDC) is an emerging concern in Pacific salmon, potentially contributing to en route and prespawn adult mortality and elevated fry mortality, yet little is known about the prevalence of TDC in Canadian Pacific salmon populations.
This project established thiamine analysis capability for fish tissues (e.g. eggs, plasma, muscle, liver) by the Nutrition lab at the DFO Pacific Science Enterprise Centre (PSEC).
Preliminary data discovered that total thiamine levels in eggs of both coho and Chinook salmon in BC generally ranged from 6 - 13 nmol/g, most pink Salmon contained 4 - 8 nmol/g, but most sockeye salmon eggs only contained 2 - 6 nmol/g, which suggests that some Pacific salmon populations in BC may exhibit TDC and warrant further monitoring.","Thiamine (Vitamin B1) is an essential water soluble vitamin for fish, supporting physiological functions such as metabolism, immune, neuron and cardiac functions (Bâ 2008; Manzetti et al. 2014; Roman-Campos and Cruz 2014; Whitfield et al. 2018), normal development (Carvalho et al. 2009), growth (Reed et al. 2023; Lee et al. 2026) and reproductive success (Fitzsimons et al. 2005; Honeyfield et al. 2005; Mantua et al. 2025). In aquatic systems, thiamine is synthesized by bacteria and phytoplankton at the base of the food web (Croft et al. 2007; Tang et al. 2010; Paerl et al. 2015; Hylander et al. 2024; Suffridge et al. 2024), and fish obtain thiamine exclusively through their diet (Fridolfsson et al. 2018; Harder et al. 2018; Ejsmond et al. 2019; Hylander et al. 2024). Thiamine deficiency complex (TDC) is a syndrome that is caused by a chronic deficiency in thiamine, impacting salmon across the life cycle. In adult salmon, reduced swimming and migratory ability, and increased pre-spawn mortality have been linked to TDC (Brown et al. 2005a; Fitzsimons et al. 2005). For early-stage salmon fry hatched from thiamine-deficient eggs, symptoms include loss of equilibrium (Fitzsimons et al. 2005), abnormal swimming behaviour (i.e. swimming in a corkscrew pattern) (Mantua et al. 2025), impaired vision and foraging ability (Carvalho et al. 2009), and high mortality (Koski et al. 1999; Mantua et al. 2025). TDC is caused by low availability of thiamine in the diet and/or ingestion of prey high in thiaminase (enzyme that degrades thiamine, Fisher et al. 1998; Brown et al. 2005a; Honeyfield et al. 2005; Houde et al. 2015; Mantua et al. 2025). Both extrinsic (e.g. changing environmental conditions, variation in the migration experience) and intrinsic factors (e.g. species, size, sex, disease state) could further modulate fish thiamine levels.

TDC has been linked to salmonid population declines globally, including Atlantic salmon Salmo salar in the Baltic Sea (Amcoff et al. 1999), lake trout Salvelinus namaycush in the Great Lakes (Ladago et al. 2020), and Chinook salmon in Alaska (Strasburger et al. 2023) and California (Mantua et al. 2025). However, there is little published information about the status of TDC in Pacific salmon, especially in British Columbia (BC), Canada (but see Welch et al. 2018). More research is thus urgently needed to investigate how thiamine status has been impacting Pacific salmon in BC, Canada. The objectives of this project were to: (1) establish thiamine analysis capacity at DFO to support studies and programs investigating the thiamine status of salmonids in Canada. Until this project, there were no Canadian labs providing thiamine analysis services, thus Canadian projects must rely on a few labs in the USA, creating a bottleneck (costly, delayed, sample loss risk) in thiamine analysis. (2) determine preliminary thiamine status in eggs collected from both wild and hatchery-derived stocks of Chinook salmon, coho salmon, pink salmon and sockeye salmon in BC. And (3) assess the effectiveness of thiamine treatment practices being tested at some DFO hatcheries. This research was conducted in collaboration with the Pelagic Ecosystem Lab at University of British Columbia (UBC), DFO Salmon Enhancement Program (SEP) and DFO Environmental Watch Program (EWATCH).","Thiamine analysis capacity was established by researchers in the Nutrition lab at the DFO Pacific Science Enterprise Centre (PSEC), based on the methodology of Brown et al. (1998) with expert advice from Dr. Jacques Rinchard from SUNY Brockport and Dr. Cody Pinger from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). To confirm the reliability of our analysis protocol, we analyzed 27 Chinook salmon egg samples collected in 2023 by Pelagic Ecosystem Lab at UBC and compared our results with those provided to UBC by the lab at SUNY Brockport. There was a strong and significant linear relationship (Fig 1; y = 0.8183 x - 0.4131) between SUNY Brockport and PSEC's results on total mean thiamine levels (p < 0.001) providing confidence that the methodology employed by PSEC is reliable and accurate. Overall, PSEC reported consistently lower total mean thiamine levels, especially lower TPP levels, compared to SUNY Brockport. This is not surprising given that PSEC conducted the analysis in 2025, almost 2 years later than SUNY Brockport. Given the sensitivity of thiamine (temperature, light, pH; Brown et al. 1998; Wright et al. 2005; Edwards et al. 2017; Rocchi et al. 2022), thiamine degradation in tissues is expected to occur over time with prolonged storage and multiple sample handing events.

Additional salmon samples from both hatcheries and the wild were collected to obtain baseline, preliminary data on the thiamine status of salmon in BC. Sample collection included: Chilliwack River hatchery coho salmon (N=10 females; eggs, plasma), Chilliwack River hatchery Chinook salmon (N=10 females; eggs, plasma), Capilano hatchery mid coho salmon (N=10 females; eggs), Harrison River sockeye salmon (N=10 females; eggs, ventricles, plasma), Chilko River sockeye salmon (N=10 females; eggs, ventricles, plasma), Weaver Creek sockeye salmon (N = 9, eggs, ventricles, plasma), Chehalis pink salmon (N = 11 females; eggs ). Tissues were immediately frozen (dry shipper or dry ice) and stored at -80oC until analysis. Ventricle and plasma analysis is ongoing, only egg data are presented here. Total thiamine levels were very similar in the Chinook and coho eggs assessed here (Figure 2), mostly ranging between 6 - 13 nmol/g. However, sockeye salmon eggs had much lower total thiamine levels of mostly 2 - 6 nmol/g, while total thiamine in pink salmon eggs mostly ranged from 4 - 8 nmol/g. Using the thiamine thresholds as established by Mantua et al. (2025), 20 - 40% of each coho and Chinook salmon population are considered as being likely impacted by thiamine deficiency to some degree (< 7.7 nmol/g; Figure 3). However, all sockeye salmon samples are below 7.7 nmol/g, with over 50 - 100% of eggs considered having low (2.7 -5.9 nmol/g) or critically low thiamine (< 2.7 nmol/g) levels. For the Chehalis pink salmon population, 72% of samples are considered to be likely thiamine deficient (< 7.7 nmol/g), with 45% of eggs in the low category (2.7 - 5.9 nmol/g; Figure 3).

To counteract the effects of TDC, thiamine supplementation is seen as an effective strategy to improve salmon reproduction success in hatcheries (Harder et al. 2025) and is currently implemented at a few DFO hatcheries. Current practices include injecting thiamine (500 mg thiamine hydrochloride) into broodfish ~12-25 days prior to spawning (Shuswap River hatchery) or immersing fertilized eggs in a static bath made of 1000 ppm thiamine mononitrate for 1 hour (Tenderfoot Creek hatchery, Capilano hatchery). We sampled thiamine-injection-treated eggs from Middle Shuswap Chinook salmon at Shuswap River hatchery (N=6, no control fish were available).We sampled both untreated (control) and thiamine-bath-treated eggs (immediately after the 1 h bath) from Cheakamus Chinook salmon at Tenderfoot Creek hatchery (N=4 females), early coho (N=20 females) , mid coho salmon (N=20 females) and late coho salmon (N=20 females) from Capilano hatchery. In addition, thiamine-bath treated eggs were sampled ~1 month post-fertilization in coho salmon from Capilano hatchery (N= 400 eggs each for early, mid and late Coho; eggs from different females were mixed; no control fish were available).

Thiamine injection-treatment (Middle Shuswap Chinook salmon at Shuswap River hatchery) produced eggs with total thiamine levels ranging between 16-27 nmol/g (Table 1). While there are no control fish for comparison, these levels are above egg thiamine levels in untreated eggs from other locations (Tenderfoot and Chilliwack hatchery Chinook salmon, Figure 2). This suggests that the thiamine injection treatment likely was effective at increasing total thiamine levels in the eggs. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of the thiamine bath treatment (Tenderfoot Creek hatchery and Capilano hatchery) could not be resolved here. Sampling eggs immediately following the 1 h thiamine bath treatment resulted in extremely elevated and highly variable total thiamine levels (range = 256.8 - 327.0 nmol/g). In fact, we were unable to determine accurate total thiamine levels for the bath-treated samples from Capilano, as the results were contradictory (i.e. varying from 0.95 - 291.20 nmol/g). While we reported consistently high total thiamine from bath-treated eggs from Tenderfoot Creek Hatchery, these levels are not biologically reasonable and were likely produced by excess thiamine associated with the bath. Given this, we sampled some eggs ~1 month post bath treatment from Capilano Hatchery and found levels to vary among batches (early coho batch#1: 0.90 ± 0.06, batch #2: 2.49 ± 0.60; mid coho batch#1: 3.86 ± 1.18; N=5 tests, unit = nmol/g). However, without control, un-treated eggs at the same life stage, we are unable to assess whether the thiamine bath treatment was successful at increasing thiamine levels in these eggs.","This project successfully established thiamine analysis capability at PSEC, which is currently the only known laboratory in Canada conducting these analyses. A detailed protocol outlining the equipment, consumables and procedural steps is available for distribution to other research groups at DFO to set up the same analysis capacity. Our lab at PSEC is currently welcoming thiamine analysis requests and collaborative projects to support research programs monitoring the thiamine status of Pacific salmon and their prey in Canada.
The thiamine levels in coho and Chinook salmon eggs were within the expected range, consistent with previous work on Chinook salmon in Alaska (Honeyfield et al. 2016; Larson and Howard 2019) and California (Mantua et al. 2025), and preliminary data available for BC (Lerner and McLaskey 2024). Notably, the relatively wide range of thiamine levels suggests considerable variation among individuals within each population. Future studies should consider increasing the sample size from each population (i.e. >10 fish per population) to have a more precise estimate of salmon thiamine status. In contrast, the total thiamine amounts in sockeye salmon eggs from Weaver Creek, Harrison and Chilko River were less variable, but also had lower levels (mostly within 2 - 6 nmol/g). While the Harrison River samples were considered not fully ripe, the thiamine levels in these eggs were similar to those of fully ripe fish in Chilko River. Notably, a previous study found much higher total thiamine levels in eggs of sockeye salmon from Harrison River, and pink salmon from Seton River in 2015 (Sockeye: 10.9 ± 1.2 nmol/g, n = 5; pink: 19.5 ± 2.3 nmol/g, n=20; Welch et al., 2018). The cause of these differences in thiamine levels between studies of the same population conducted ~10 years apart is unknown, but may be related to changes in prey (and thus dietary thiamine/thiaminase levels), changing ocean or migration conditions or other factors not identified.
Based on the thiamine thresholds by Mantua et al. (2025), 20 - 40 % of the eggs analyzed from each coho and Chinook salmon population in this study, are considered to be likely impacted by thiamine deficiency (Figure 3). However, the total thiamine in all eggs from sockeye salmon from both Harrison and Chilko River are well below this threshold, and only 27% of Chehalis pink salmon eggs were above it. It must also be noted that the threshold from Mantua et al. (2025) is set based on Chinook salmon, but the susceptibility to TDC, or thiamine threshold, is likely species-specific (Brown et al. 2005b; Fitzsimons et al. 2007; Honeyfield et al. 2008; Harder et al. 2018). To our knowledge, there are no published data on thiamine status of sockeye and pink salmon other than Welch et al. (2018). Future research should track thiamine status of Pacific salmon in BC, especially sockeye salmon.

The broodfish-thiamine-injection method appeared to effectively improve the total thiamine levels, mostly in form of TH, in Chinook salmon eggs. Although there were no untreated, control eggs available as a comparison at Shuswap River Hatchery, the injection-treated eggs (20.5 ± 4.8 nmol/g, range from 16 - 27 nmol/g) contained up to 2 - 3 times the usual thiamine amount in untreated eggs of other Chinook salmon stocks (Figure 2 and 3, 6 - 13 nmol/g). The total thiamine levels in eggs from these injection-treated fish are within the range reported for similar studies on coho salmon (21.925 ±1.694 nmol/g, Fitzsimons et al., 2005) and steelhead trout Oncorhynchus mykiss (total thiamine 20.4 ± 11.3 nmol/g; Futia et al 2017; mean total thiamine: 33.5 nmol/g, range: 15.4 - 51.1 nmol/g; Reed et al 2023). Unfortunately, our study could not resolve the effectiveness of thiamine bath-treated eggs because of supra-biological and varying levels measured in eggs sampled immediately after the 1 h treatment bath (e.g. 302.5 ± 31.2 nmol/g in Chinook salmon at Tenderfoot Creek hatchery; 0.95 - 291.20 nmol/g in mid Coho salmon eggs at Capilano Hatchery). Thus, it was unknown how much of the thiamine was actually retained and biologically available to the eggs over time. Future work should resolve the effectiveness and necessity of these thiamine treatments, as these methods could prove highly valuable in both minimizing the potential negative impacts of TDC on early fry and optimizing hatchery salmon production (Futia et al. 2017; Reed et al. 2023; Harder et al. 2025).","With the thiamine analysis capacity established at PSEC, DFO can now further expand research relevant to thiamine and fish in Canada. First of all, more research is urgently needed to determine the status of TDC across stocks of all 5 species of Pacific salmon in BC and the Yukon, across the life cycle (especially adults and eggs). Second, we need to establish how thiamine levels vary across tissue types (e.g. muscle, ventricle, liver, plasma, eggs) and identify whether plasma thiamine levels could be used as a non-lethal indicator of adult salmon thiamine status. Third, we need to establish the thiamine and thiaminase status of the primary prey species in both ocean and freshwater habitats and how these may be changing over time. As such, a next step for the Nutrition lab at PSEC is to establish a protocol for thiaminase activity and begin collaborating with other groups to collect and assess prey. Fourth, we need to determine TDC thresholds for impairment for all 5 species of Pacific salmon species, in both eggs and migrating adults. Finally, we need carefully controlled experiments to assess the effectiveness and necessity of thiamine treatment (both bathing eggs and injecting broodstock) for hatcheries in BC.","Table 1.

Scale corticosteroid content can differ by underlying factors such as sex or life-stage. Furthermore, both cortisol and cortisone content rapidly increases in scales following a single acute stressor and returns to baseline levels within 72 hours. Both corticosteroids can also decrease at increasing rates while under chronic stress. Finally, the dynamics of scale corticosteroids can differ depending on the type of prolonged stress.
Implications: As scale corticosteroids can be elevated while plasma values are normal following acute stress, and the opposite can occur during chronic stress, we do not currently recommend using scale cortisol, nor cortisone, as biomarkers of chronic stress in Chinook salmon.","Exposure of fish to stressors can elicit physiological changes at multiple levels of animal organization, these alterations are collectively known as the stress response. The hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) axis which is activated in response to most forms of stress in fish, initiates and regulates the stress response. In fish cortisol is the predominant glucocorticoid released as part of the primary stress response, and is critical for mediating adaptive metabolic, physiological, and behavioral adjustments. However, prolonged elevation of cortisol, due to extended or repeated exposure to stressors, caused chronic stress that can negatively affect fish behavior, growth, reproduction, and immune functions (reviewed in Schreck and Tort, 2016). With respect to salmon, the period of parr-to-smolt transition (smoltification) is one of the most sensitive periods to stressors, with chronic stress resulting in impaired ability to smolt (Bernard et al., 2019; Vehanen et al., 2023). For these reasons, there is a significant need to identify and validate biomarkers of chronic stress in different stages of Pacific salmon, which can be used identify and where possible control/manage factors lo reduce levels of chronic stress.
The analysis of circulating (serum/plasma) cortisol is the most common method used in stress response assessments in fish. This method works well under controlled situations, where fish can be caught and rapidly sampled (within minutes to avoid the rapid increase in cortisol which occurs in response to capture stress) and it provides information on the acute stress response at the time of collection (immediate state of stress). To understand chronic stress the past cortisol history of individuals needs to be understood, Unfortunately, due to how cortisol is physiologically regulated, circulating cortisol levels are well recognized as poor predictors of chronic stress (Aerts et al., 2015).
In higher vertebrates, measurement of cortisol in hair (Raul et al., 2004) and feathers (Macbeth et al., 2010), has been demonstrated to allow for retrospective assessment of levels of stress. Building upon these studies fish scales were identified as a biomaterial that accumulates cortisol, and other physiologically important hormones including cortisone, over long periods of time. The measurement of scale cortisol content was proposed as a way to determine past cortisol history in fish, and for use as a biomarker of chronic stress (Aerts et al., 2015; de Vrieze et al., 2012). However, unlike hair and feathers in which cortisol levels remain fixed after deposition, the exchange of cortisol between the circulatory system and scales is an ongoing dynamic process, which is poorly understood, Moreover, scale cortisol levels appear not to be affected by single acute stress events such as those associated with capture (reviewed in Laberge et al. 2019; Kennedy and Janz, 2023).
This project examined the usefulness of the measurement of scale stress hormone content (SSHHC) biomarker of chronic stress in Pacific salmon. Laboratory and hatchery-based studies were conducted to determine and validate/optimize: 1) sampling methods (e.g. study spatial heterogeneity of scale stress hormone content (SSHC)), 2) effects of acute vs. chronic stress on SSHC, 3) relationship between plasma and SSHC, 4) individual, stock and temporal variability in SSHC, including changes associated with smoltification, and 5) effects of unpredictable chronic stress on plasma and SSHC.
This project was in collaboration with the Bernier and Laberge labs at the University of Guelph. Gill homogenate NKA activity was measured by the BC Centre for Aquatic Health Sciences (Campbell River, BC, Canada).",,"Overall, this project has vastly elevated our understanding of scale corticosteroid dynamics and usability for Chinook (and Coho, to a lesser degree) salmon.

While scale cortisol content has been proposed as a reliable, retrospective look into the stress history of fishes, similar to hair (Koren et al. 2011) or feathers (Macbeth et al. 2010), our data shows that levels of corticosteroids in fish scales are far more dynamic than previously thought.

In juvenile Chinook salmon, the measurement of scale corticosteroids has limited use as biomarkers of chronic stress, due to their susceptibility to acute stress, rapid clearance after acute stress, and the onset of a corticosteroid clearance response under prolonged chronic stress. Furthermore, both scale cortisone and the scale cortisol-cortisone ratio were found to be less consistent, more variable, and cleared faster than scale cortisol, and thus are unlikely to be better biomarkers of chronic stress than scale cortisol alone. Whether this is true for other species of salmon is unclear.

Our results identify a number of factors necessary to consider when planning studies and/or evaluating/interpreting the results of previously published studies, to ensure that measured differences in scale corticosteroids are due to differences in how the fish are responding to their environment rather than being an artefact of study design.",,"Figure 1.

Findings: We measured the otoliths of outmigrating Chinook and constructed FL-otolith radii regression relationships: determined that they were segmented break-point models and river system specific. We focused on PSSI priority WCVI systems: identified population specific patterns of estuary entry and residency for the Sarita, Nitinat, Stamp, Bedwell and San Juan systems.
Implications: Microchemistry analysis reveals that Chinook Salmon in each river system have a unique proportion of several life-history patterns, including whether they leave as fry or parr, use the estuary for an extended period of time or merely transit through it, and then either remain in the marine environment or return for a duration of time to their own or another river's estuary.","Impetus: WCVI natural-origin (NO) Chinook are very important for the economic, social and cultural well being of many coastal communities, including First Nations, and both freshwater & marine ecological communities. Low early marine survival has been identified as a threat for rebuilding these stocks and has been understudied in NO Chinook
Knowledge gap: A method was needed to identify successful life-history types in returning adults in order to determine how best to rebuild them. Analysis of otolith microchemistry can fill this gap because otoliths are inert once incorporated and preserve chemical signals related to environmental patterns (e.g. transition from fresh to saltwater) unlike other tissues such as bone and scales. This means analyzing the chemistry across the otolith can reveal where salmon were through time at some size and stage.
Partnerships: Otoliths have been stored by DFO from collections undertaken by many programs including Stock Assessment and the more recent Follow the Fish program. Collaboration with these programs can provide a large archive of both current and historical otoliths to analyse microchemically and track the changes across the life spans of individual fish and the changes in life-history patterns of populations from past to present.","This project is the first to develop the capacity to use otolith microchemistry analysis by Laser Ablation-Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) internally within DFO. With the existing instruments and expertise housed in the Mass Spectrometry Lab at IOS, we have the capacity to microchemically analyse thousands of otoliths per year in a cost effective manner and use the life-history knowledge gleaned from them to inform fisheries and conservation policy.
This technique involves polishing otoliths to expose the earliest layers, which are formed before the fish hatches, and then vaporising a line transect from the core to edge with a tiny, precise laser connected to a mass spectrometer. The spectrometer counts and identifies the changing elemental composition of the otolith material over each fish's life-span, and the timing of these changes can be calculated based on the known speed and position of the laser beam and applied to real world times and locations of relevance.
Findings:
Otolith microchemistry of WCVI Chinook shows evidence for freshwater to marine carry-over effects
Most NO juveniles leave the estuary early and small as fry, but the small percentage of later, larger parr outmigrants have a much higher survival rate, although the proportions differ by year and river system
While hatchery origin (HO) outmigrants have a higher survival rate overall than NO outmigrants, the larger, later NO outmigrants survive better than their similarly sized HO counterparts
The largest, oldest returning spawners tend disproportionately to have been early, small outmigrants. Therefore, releasing hatchery juveniles as late, large outmigrants appears to be promoting the return of spawners as younger, smaller adults which may be driving follow-on effects such as lower fecundity, fewer eggs per female, smaller average egg sizes and increased competition for optimal redd sites.","Our research has really highlighted the need to address Pacific salmon stocks from the perspective of life history types, rather than as monoliths. By identifying what life-history types leave the river and what life-history types return, we can identify differential survival across these life-history types and start getting at what makes a successful Pacific salmon. This can improve Pacific salmon management by providing assessments of how habitat, such as freshwater rearing habitat, may improve the overall survival of stocks by allowing more members of the population to make use of a more successful life history type. We have also shown that there are different ages at return amongst life history types, which could improve management by addressing not only changes in survival, but changes in fitness. By addressing carry over effects of early life history decisions, we can start to better address where the bottlenecks to survival exist and how targeted restoration could be rolled out.",,"Figure 1.

Secwépemc Fisheries Commission",,Coho,North Thompson,Juvenile,Interior,,,,"This project developed and applied methods to estimate instream flow needs for juvenile salmonids in a warming climate. Habitat simulation models incorporating temperature were developed in 17 coho rearing tributaries across the North Thompson watershed.

Relationships between flow and rearing habitat availability varied across streams, suggesting that conventional generic low flow thresholds may not be widely applicable. Temperature effects on flow-habitat relationships were also variable, but in some cases suggested higher flows are required if temperatures are warmer.

Model outputs will inform real-time hydrometric monitoring and planning in the North Thompson, but the methods are broadly applicable to other salmon systems where both flow and temperature are of interest.","Low flows during summer months can be an important bottleneck for stream-rearing rearing salmon. Determining how much water fish need is therefore a critical management question, especially given rising human water use and climate warming. Elevated water temperature is another threat facing stream-rearing salmon that is often linked to low flows. However, conventional modelling tools for determining instream flow needs have generally not explicitly considered temperature. This is a gap for management as it is unclear if current instream flow assessments will apply in a warmer future.


This project developed an analytical framework to integrate water temperature into habitat simulation models, a widely used tool for determining instream flow needs. We used a bioenergetics framework that relates channel hydraulics (e.g., depth and velocity) and temperature to the daily energy balance of juvenile salmonids. We then applied the approach to 17 coho-rearing streams across the North Thompson watershed, interior BC. This work was collaborative with Secwépemc Fisheries Commission and Simpcw First Nation and will inform instream flow management through the lens of climate change.","We used a habitat simulation model framework that links streamflow to channel hydraulics, then channel hydraulics to fish using bioenergetics. The end result is a matrix of relative habitat availability across combinations of flow and water temperature. This can be used as a tool to support real-time flow and temperature monitoring or be linked to flow and temperature projections under contrasting climate change scenarios. Initial model outputs have been shared with Secwépemc Fisheries Commission to support drought monitoring in several priority systems.

Flow-habitat relationships were variable across the different streams, suggesting that generic thresholds of flow (e.g., 20% of mean annual discharge) may not always apply. The combined effect of flow and temperature was also variable, reflecting the complex nonlinear pathways that temperature influences fish.

While the specific model outputs generated to date are applicable to the North Thompson, the general approach is broadly applicable to other systems where the combined impacts of flow and temperature change are of interest.","Flow and temperature are both critical habitat dimensions for salmon in freshwater, but there is still significant uncertainty in their combined effects on fish. This study provides a framework to integrate temperature into instream flow models, which support a number of management decisions, including regulatory authorizations, watershed planning, and water governance. It is also relevant for cumulative effects, where flow and temperature are common pathways where various activities impact salmon and their ecosystems.

As with any modelling tool, there are simplifications and assumptions that should temper inferences. The approach developed here is intentionally simple and conforms to conventional habitat simulation modelling constraints. This simplicity is a benefit in that it maintains tractability, but a limitation in that the method is subject to many of the longstanding critiques of habitat simulation modelling approaches (see Railsback 2016).","Undertaking this work highlighted several important empirical knowledge gaps that should be the focus of future studies. First, there is surprisingly scarce empirical data on how salmonids shift their behaviour and habitat use at high temperatures in the wild. Predictions from our models at high temperatures should therefore be tempered. Second, there is considerable variation in how flow and temperature covary. For instance, low flows are often associated with warming water temperature, but this may not be the case in systems with groundwater influence. Work to better predict these complex dynamics would benefit the application of this modelling tool.

The analytical framework developed from this project is accessible and should be readily available to interested practitioners. Habitat simulation modelling is widely used and the advances from this project can be readily integrated (see Naman et al. 2020). Model outputs can provide a more dynamic perspective on flow needs for fish in a warming climate.","Figure 1.

SEL-06-20, SEL-09-02, SEL-09-03, SER-03","Human activities, landscape disturbances, and climate change are presenting numerous individual and cumulative threats to fish and their freshwater habitat across British Columbia (BC). Modern tools and approaches for tracking and assessing these threats are needed to support responsive and integrated regulatory, planning, partnership, and monitoring activities to help safeguard fish and fish habitat.
We developed geospatial estimates of individual and cumulative threats to salmon and Species At Risk habitat in the Fraser River Basin from human activities, landscape disturbance, and climate change (e.g. pollutant loading, sedimentation, flow alteration, high stream temperatures). We modelled and mapped 13 threats for the full stream network and identified where and for which species threats were higher. We further applied the threat scores and indicators of important habitat for salmon in the Thompson-Nicola to help inform restoration planning for salmon ecosystems.
This project is the first to provide spatially extensive estimates of freshwater threats to salmon and inform how restoration and management actions can potentially improve population outcomes. The estimated threats are now used in salmon population life-cycle modelling to evaluate the impact on salmon across their freshwater life cycle.","Understanding where and how fish and fish habitat are impacted by human activities and climate change is critical information for targeting effective conservation and management actions to help preserve populations. Geospatial cumulative effects assessments offer a powerful approach for evaluating simultaneous threats across large spatial scales, improving upon traditional field-based assessments (Halpern et al. 2008a; Halpern and Fujita 2013). However, many existing assessments rely on simple proxies of human activity (e.g., road density) rather than mechanistic metrics that directly link stressors to ecological responses relevant to fish and fish habitat (e.g., sediment loading or flow alteration) to provide more meaningful applications (e.g., stressor-response curves; Rosenfeld et al. 2022). To address this gap, this project advanced existing geospatial tools, indicators, and threat metrics for the Pacific Region (DFO 2022) by incorporating a mechanistic approach to better quantify anthropogenic and climate change impacts and inform management actions for salmon and Species at Risk (SAR) in the Fraser River Basin (FRB).

The Thompson-Shuswap and Nicola River watersheds were identified as pilot areas to deliver Integrated Planning for Salmon Ecosystems (IPSE) under the Pacific Salmon Strategy Initiative (PSSI). Within the scope of this project, we conducted a case-study on the Thompson-Nicola Ecological Drainage Unit (EDU) by developing examples of how individual and cumulative threat scores can be applied to help inform restoration prioritization and management actions. The Thompson-Nicola spatial analysis was used to inform IPSE collaborative planning processes in the Thompson-Nicola watersheds.","We developed a geospatial tool to summarize anthropogenic and climate change related cumulative threats to freshwater species and habitats using open-source input data and software that can be reproduced for different time periods and freshwater species and their habitats. All threats were estimated for each stream reach within the BC Freshwater Atlas (FWA). We derived nine individual human-activity and landscape disturbance threats: aquatic invasive species, riparian disturbance, in-stream habitat destruction, flow alteration, latitudinal fragmentation, sedimentation, pollutant loading, and nutrient loading. The input data was processed and combined to produce an individual threat score that characterizes the mechanism of disturbance to freshwater species for each score. For climate change threats, we compiled model outputs of projected stream flow and temperature to estimate threats of flood-risk, low and high stream flow, and high summer stream temperature from 2040-2060 under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. The individual threat scores were standardized across the study area, weighted equally, and added together to calculate a human activity and landscape disturbance cumulative threat score and a climate change based cumulative threat score (see Iacarella et al. 2025 for detailed methods). Finally, both cumulative threat scores were paired with salmon and SAR distributions (i.e., CU boundaries and delineated stream habitats, respectively) and evaluated to identify where threats were greatest and which species and CUs were exposed to the highest threat levels.

For the Thompson-Nicola EDU case study, we focused on human activity threats that may reasonably be mitigated, including riparian disturbance, water withdrawal, and longitudinal fragmentation from dams. We identified overlap between these threats and two approaches used to identify areas important to salmon: (1) CU delineations and (2) modelled environmentally favourable spawning habitats. The modelled environmentally favourability predictions were derived from large-scale environmental niche models to predict shifts in habitat favourability from current to future climate conditions (Iacarella and Weller 2023). We multiplicatively combined threat scores with environmental favourability for salmon spawning to create composite scores that reflect a gradient of potential management implications (see Fig. 20 in Iacarella et al. 2025). A high threat score combined with a high favourable habitat probability identifies an area that warrants localized investigation and potential restoration or mitigation actions. Conversely, a low threat score combined with a low favourable habitat probability identifies an area that is less likely to need management attention based on salmon values (i.e., predicted spawning habitat) and low level of anthropogenic impact.

Our results indicated the highest cumulative threat scores around the lower Fraser River and within the interior plateau of the FRB for both human activity and landscape disturbance based threats and climate change based threats (Figure 1). Watershed groups with the highest median cumulative threats were the Nicola River, Guichon Creek, and San Jose River. These heightened scores were predominately driven by riparian disturbance, nutrients, and sedimentation for the human activity based threats and high stream temperatures for the climate change based threats. Roads were the most frequent input that influenced human activity based threats across the FRB, and contributed consistently to in-stream habitat destruction, riparian disturbance, nutrients, and sedimentation. Other important inputs to these threats were forest fires, forest pest defoliation, rangeland, and forestry. We found that SAR with limited ranges (i.e., Coastrange Sculpin, Green Sturgeon, Nooksack Dace, and Salish Sucker) had higher median human activity cumulative threat scores relative to all streams in the FRB, corresponding to their at risk status (Figure 2). Median human activity threat scores tended to be more similar among salmon CUs and relative to all streams, though a few of the Threatened and Endangered Sockeye salmon CUs had notably higher median threat scores (Figure 2).

Within the Thompson-Nicola EDU, median cumulative threat composite scores within watershed groups based on the multiplicative value of human activity cumulative threats and favourable spawning habitat under current and future conditions were highest for Sockeye (Figure 3). The greatest shifts in median composite scores from current to future climate conditions (i.e., based on changes in predicted spawning favourability), were increases in Upper North Thompson River for Chinook (median score change = 0.14), Bonaparte River for Pink (0.06), and Deadman River for Sockeye (0.11), and a decrease in Thompson River for Coho (-0.06). Overall, the Deadman and Adams River watershed groups were identified as having the highest cumulative composite scores under current and future climate conditions across salmon species in the EDU.","This project is the first to provide spatially extensive estimates of human activity and climate change threats that are directly linked to salmon, SAR, and their habitats at the stream reach scale. The approaches used to estimate each of the indicators provide an initial broad-scale standardized framework that can be applied to characterize threats throughout the Pacific Region. Within the FRB, we observed the highest threats in the Lower Fraser and interior plateau, and specifically, within the Nicola River, Guichon Creek, and San Jose River. Overall, roads were the greatest contributor to human activity-based threats, disturbing in-stream habitats, riparian areas, and contributing to sediment and nutrient loading. These results improve our understanding of the spatial distribution and relative magnitude of threats across the FRB, providing a foundation for predicting population-level impacts from cumulative effects and life-cycle modelling.

A major source of uncertainty is the spatial accuracy of the BC Freshwater Atlas. Known issues to the FWA include overestimates of headwater streams in interior regions, misaligned stream delineations and large river catchment areas. Each of the individual threat scores have their own uncertainties and limitations, as detailed in Table 2 of Iacarella et al. (2025). In general, the input data are subject to limitations arising from potentially misclassified land cover or land use, features included in datasets but not present on the landscape, and unmapped activities or features, which introduce uncertainty into individual threat scores and the cumulative score. An additional source of uncertainty is the unresolved habitat use and distribution of salmon and SAR within the FRB. The approach used to combine individual threats into a cumulative threat score (e.g., addition, multiplication, etc.) is another source of uncertainty that can be evaluated in future work by modelling population responses to individual and cumulative threats.","Although our threat estimates represent the mechanisms by which salmon and freshwater SAR are affected, the magnitude at which these threats influence salmon population dynamics remains unknown. To address this gap, we are continuing to refine existing threat estimates and developing new threats that are explicitly linked to stressor-response functions for cumulative effects and life-cycle modelling. For example, we have developed additional riparian disturbance metrics that better capture the impacts to riparian function (e.g., large-woody debris recruitment, disturbance to stream-shading, riparian filtering), which were not included in the original report. Moreover, we are developing a stage-structured population model for Interior Fraser Coho (IFC) to estimate how stressors (estimated threats) are influencing the population across their freshwater life stages. For this work, we are utilising the Cumulative Effects Model for Prioritizing Recovery Actions (CEMPRA), which applies stressor-response functions to account for the impact of stressors on vital rates and the overall population overtime and under different climate change and mitigation scenarios (Bayly et al. 2024).

Additional next steps for this work include expanding the cumulative threats model to other watersheds in the Pacific Region. To date, the model has also been applied to the Upper Bulkley Watershed to aid in salmon habitat restoration planning. Validation is an important step of most modelling exercises, though is often not a standard component of cumulative effect assessments (Halpern and Fujita 2013). Validating these threats through field verification and in situ data would be beneficial for threats that involve applied relationships and estimations, such as the flow accumulated loadings (i.e., nutrients, pollution, sedimentation). Future work could re-run the model at regular intervals to evaluate change in threats over time. Finally, additional analyses could quantify uncertainty in modelled threats and evaluate underlying assumptions through sensitivity tests.","Figure 1.

This project tests the hypothesis that early marine survival of Sakinaw Sockeye is negatively impacted by local predation at the Hodgson Island pinniped haul-out shortly after smolts enter the marine environment. If correct, smolts transported via boat past Hodgson Island, into Malaspina Strait, would have higher marine survival than smolts that outmigrate from Sakinaw Lake and pass the haul-out on their own. Marine survival is assessed by comparing the adult returns from PIT tagged transported smolts and hatchery PIT tagged fry and smolts released in the lake.

Transporting via aerated tanks on a boat is a successful method for moving smolts past the pinniped haul-out (Hodgson Island). Survival to release was over 99% and release condition and behavior was observed to be excellent.
Marine survival comparisons are still being monitored, with the 2024 transport group returning as adults in summer 2026. Preliminary results from the 2023 transport group indicate that survival was not improved for the transported smolts, with only 1 PIT tagged transport fish returning to the lake as an adult.
Implications:
Early marine survival may not be the limiting factor for this population. If transport returns continue to be low in the 2026 adult return, the recommendation would be to not pursue smolt transport as a restoration tool for Sakinaw Sockeye. See Insights and Next Steps for more detail.","Sakinaw Sockeye have been listed as endangered with COSEWIC since 2003, and a Species at Risk Act Recovery Potential Assessment (RPA) was completed in 2017 (Ramshaw et al. 2019). The RPA cited low marine survival as the greatest limiting factor in recovery, with predator abundance and assumed predation on smolts and adults ranked as high risk, with a critical level of impact. Perpetually low marine survivals are preventing recovery such that the persistence of the population is entirely dependent on a captive brood program.

Sakinaw Sockeye smolts out-migrate from Sakinaw Lake each spring into the Malaspina Strait and Strait of Georgia. Localized marine predation is considered a major limiting factor for the survival of this stock. On water surveys (since 2019) of pinnipeds from the estuary to the seal haul-outs on Hodgson Islands (approximately 2km from the estuary, Figure 1) have observed approximately 100-350 harbour seals in the area during the spring out-migration.

This project was started as a pilot (2022) in collaboration with shíshálh Nation to test the hypothesis that the Hodgson Island harbour seal population is negatively affecting smolt survival, and subsequently adult returns. The goal of the project is to transport and release smolts past the seal haul-out and then compare marine survival rates between transported smolts and those out-migrating naturally. The pilot project began with a low number of smolts transported in small trial releases to test the effect of handling, Passive Integrated Transponders (PIT) tagging, and increased osmoregulation on fish.

The initial proposal indicated a minimum of 1,000 and up to 2,500 PIT tagged sockeye are recommended per year such that a 1% survival will yield a total of 10-25 tag returns. Return rates of less than 1% may be too low to justify operationalizing this activity long term. Return rates for smolts entering the estuary naturally are well documented through annual census programs so additional tagging of a control group is not necessary.","Methods
All sockeye smolts outmigrating from Sakinaw Lake encounter a smolt fence with a slide and overhead camera. A portion or all smolts can be directed into a trap box (6x6x3' aluminum framed) depending on slide configuration (Figure 2). For the purpose of this project the slide was set to 100% capture to meet tagging goals.

Smolts were tagged with Biomark APT12 PIT Tags (12 x 2.12 mm, 0.1 g). Following sedation with TMS (Tricaine methanesulfonate), the tags are injected into the body cavity with an individual pre-loaded 12-guage needle and a Biomark MK 25 implanter. Tagged fish were then scanned and recorded via Biomark BioLogic DCM digital board, Biomark hand scanner, and a bluetooth connected tablet (Figure 3). Tag insertion and fish handling techniques described in the Columbia River PIT Tag Marking Procedures Manual (Columbia Basin Fish & Wildlife Authority PIT Tag Steering Committee, 1999) were modified slightly. As per recommendations from the DFO Veterinarian, the procedure for tagging was to insert the needle ahead of the pelvic girdle along the midline and inject the tag forward. Air bubblers and ice were used in each tagging bin to keep water temperatures cool and well oxygenated. Following tagging, smolts were returned to the trap box for recovery.

Smolts were held in recovery for a minimum of three hours before the transportation process began. At high-tide, shíshálh Nation's 30' Landing Craft was brought into the estuary, where six large plastic garbage bins on board were filled with saltwater and frozen water bottles (500ml). At the smolt fence & trap box, eight waterproof backpacks (dry bags) were filled with ~5 gallons of water and 50 smolts (Figure 4). Smolts were carried 900 m down to the beach, where they were transported to the Landing Craft via 12' skiff with electric motor. Smolts were then poured into the garbage bins with 20 mg/L of O2 from an oxygen tank (Figure 5). Smolts were then transported and released in the Malaspina Strait.

Key Results
PIT tagging sample size objectives were achieved (1000-2500 tags). It was determined that sample size objectives could be met during the peak of smolt outmigration under normal operating conditions, as seen in 2023 & 2024, with the number of fish PIT tagged exceeding the goal of 2500 (Table 1).
Transporting via aerated tanks on a boat is a successful method for moving smolts past the pinniped haul-out (Hodgson Island). Survival to release was over 99% and release condition and behavior was observed to be excellent.
Challenges included high water temperatures during tagging and transport. This was mitigated with ice and a start date earlier in May.
Marine survival comparisons are still being monitored, with the 2024 transport group returning as adults in summer 2026. Preliminary results from the 2023 transport group indicate that survival was not improved for the transported smolts, with only 1 PIT tagged transport fish returning to the lake as an adult.","This project was an exploration of new options to restore the Sakinaw Sockeye population to a self-sustaining run. It was conducted at a pilot scale to avoid making large investments in equipment or infrastructure before understanding the effectiveness of smolt transport as a tool to increase adult returns.

Given the timelines of the project in relation to the biology of the population we don't yet have all of the results in hand. Preliminary findings from the first group of ~2,600 smolts suggests this is not an effective tool at increasing survival due to low (1) returns in 2025. A second cohort of over 5000 tags is expected to return in summer 2026 and will confirm these results.

Assuming a similarly low return in 2026 the recommendation is to not pursue smolt transport as a restoration tool for Sakinaw Sockeye. If the results are taken at face value they do raise some important discussion points and potential future directions. For example, early marine survival may not be the limiting factor for this population and later stage mortality may be more important than previously thought. Further investigations should focus on the hypothesis that late stage mortality is an important factor for this population based on the known milling behavior in the terminal area. It has been well documented that Sakinaw Sockeye adults school and stage in the bay while waiting for optimal migration conditions. These are typically described as a high tide at night with sufficient water levels which only occur on specific days within key migration months (e.g. July). Prolonged staging could be exposing this population to higher levels of predation than for example Fraser bound Sockeye and should be specifically evaluated.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Moreover; stock composition data from the Johnstone Strait test fishery indicate Sakinaw Sockeye are regularly encountered each season. Although numbers are low (<10/yr) the probability of this occurring should be near zero when comparing current escapements (low hundreds) to Fraser River run size (low millions; or 1 in 10,000). This suggests there are more adults enroute to Sakinaw than expected providing additional support for the above hypothesis.

Revisit Sockeye test fishing data and conduct a run reconstruction to estimate the pre-terminal abundance of Sakinaw Sockeye relative to escapement.
Work with test fishing crews in 2026 to scan some or all of the test fishing catch with a PIT antenna as sets are spilled during enumeration (underway). Tags in adults should be at a maximum this year and any IDs detected can be compared to results from the river to estimate survival.
Increase monitoring of staging behavior in the bay particularly in the month of July (peak season). Consider installation of fixed SONAR stations in the bay to look for evidence of predation, particularly at night as fish attempt river entry. Overhead camera installations with zoom capability may also be useful.
Consider PIT tagging clipped adults in the test fishery to test the above hypothesis. This should be combined with DNA sampling to ensure they are Sakinaw origin fish. Alternatively; consider applying acoustic tags and receivers to see where mortality is occurring. Sakinaw Sockeye may stand out in the catch given their relatively small size and adipose clip. Dip netting individuals out of the bunt could be explored. Sorting entire sets is not feasible unless the boat is chartered specifically for that activity.

At this time the recommendation is to avoid operationalizing smolt transport activities to support recovery of Sakinaw Sockeye. It also brings into question the utility of similar activities that are designed to mitigate high early marine survival (e.g. net pens).; Following the recommendations above, here are a few directions to go with respect to future work:

>>>>>>> joe-temp
To apply a combination of frequent (biweekly-monthly) plankton biomass, taxonomy, productivity, and oceanographic measurements to characterize and enhance understanding of prey availability for early marine phase salmonids in the Strait of Georgia, British Columbia, Canada.
Key findings:
Biomass of key prey groups, euphausiids, amphipods, and decapod larvae, was greater than the long-term baseline (1996-2021); but each varied by ~2-3X between project years (2022-2025)
Total biomass for all zooplankton was also above the long-term mean during 2022-2025 but less variable between years (~1.25X)
The efficiency of energy transfer (TTE) between phytoplankton and zooplankton was directly measured for the first time in the Strait of Georgia. Seasonal variability was larger than interannual and the pattern was consistent across years. On average, annual upper water column estimates of the proportion of phytoplankton production available to consumers of zooplankton was between ~7-15%. TTE in the northern and southern Strait of Georgia was elevated relative to the north during the productive spring/summer seasons.
Implications of these findings for salmon and decision-makers:
A robust model for juvenile Cowichan chinook juvenile survival (Perry et al. 2021) is being used to compare against routine FM forecasts. Predictions using this model are highly sensitive to variation of total zooplankton biomass and sea surface properties. We have introduced additional information about food web efficiency which complements this modeling by adding quantitative information facilitating calculation of potential yield based on production at the base of the food web. This information is important to development/refinement of ecosystem-scale approaches to stock assessment.","Management of salmon stocks relies on the success of adult return forecasts, which in turn rely on good census of animals at key stages of their life history. Mortality during early life history stages, freshwater and early ocean, can be high (Beamish and Mahnken, 2001). Factors hypothesized to influence juvenile survival during early ocean phase include size at age, predation, and environmental variability which includes prey availability (amount and timing) and prey quality (Irvine et al. 2024). The Strait of Georgia is an important foraging habitat for all salmon species originating in the Fraser River and some East Coast Vancouver Island watersheds. This large marine estuary is subject to anthropogenic pressures (ship traffic, urbanization) and significant climate variability including increasing frequency of marine heatwaves which can disrupt seasonality and alter the type and amount zooplankton prey available to juvenile salmon.

This project was focused on the zooplankton component of prey availability for out-migrating fish in the Strait of Georgia. Our objective was to take advantage of relatively high frequency (biweekly-monthly) plankton sampling in an effort to characterize seasonal, interannual, and spatial variability of: 1) the biomass of bulk zooplankton and groups targeted by juvenile salmonids; and 2) apply novel methods to measure productivity at the base of the food web and estimate the potential energy available to consumers of zooplankton in the Strait of Georgia. Sampling, development, and implementation of plankton productivity measurements was carried as part of long-term DFO programming in the Salish Sea, supplemented with DFO-PSSI funding support. The project collaborates and supports research with academic partners at the University of Victoria and University of British Columbia as well as the Pacific Salmon Foundations 'Citizen Science program' and 'Bottlenecks' programs.","Zooplankton monitoring:
Seasonal monitoring of zooplankton relied on taxonomic enumeration of zooplankton samples collected throughout the Strait of Georgia from one of several vessels, CCG Neocaligus, CCG Vector, CCG Tully, CCG Franklin, R/V Richardson Point and R/V John Strickland, during the 2022-2025 project period (Figure 1). Zooplankton were sampled using vertical tows with ~60 cm mouth diameter, 250 μm mesh SCOR or Bongo nets. Both nets have similar sampling efficiencies (McKinnell and Mackas 2003) and have been used consistently from 2015 onward. Nets were equipped with calibrated flow meters and towed vertically at 1 m s-1 from ~ 10 m above bottom to the surface. Net contents were concentrated and preserved in 10% sodium-borate formalin-seawater solution. Samples were enumerated at the Plankton Ecology laboratory, Institute of Ocean Sciences, Sidney, BC, according to Perry et al. 2021).

Crustacean zooplankton composition in the Strait of Georgia was relatively unchanged relative to the years leading up to 2022. Two groups common to juvenile salmon and forage fish stomach contents, were: 1) calanoid copepods, which dominated total biomass most years and regions with biomass developing through late-winter/spring to a seasonal maximum in late spring; and 2) euphausiids were also dominant with a later seasonality, typically reaching annual maxima in late summer, but this pattern varied between region and project years. On annual timescales, biomass anomalies for total biomass and the four common zooplankton prey groups (calanoid copepods, euphausiids, amphipods, and decapod larvae) were greater than their long term mean (1996-2021). Biomass anomalies for all groups have been positive since 2018 and euphausiids, decapod larvae, and amphipods, since 2015 (Figure 2).

Plankton productivity and trophic transfer efficiency:
A subset of three deep-water (> 300 m) stations (Figure 1, red symbols) were selected for measurement and comparison of plankton production rates and calculation of energy transfer efficiency (commonly referred to as trophic transfer efficiency, TTE) between phytoplankton and crustacean zooplankton. We estimated both seasonal and annual production rates and TTE was estimated as the ratio of crustacean zooplankton to phytoplankton production rates. Crustacean zooplankton biomass production rates (BPR): We used a field application of a biochemical method based on the amount and rate at which the crustacean zooplankton moulting enzyme, chitobiase, is released into the water column (Sastri and Dower 2009). Briefly, seawater samples were collected from multiple standard depths spanning the depth range of net tows; incubated and serially subsampled for 24 hours to follow the rate of enzyme decay. Chitobiase activity in seawater subsamples was measured with a fluorometric assay and depth-specific production rates calculated on the basis of published relationships between zooplankton somatic growth and enzyme activity. Gross phytoplankton production rates (GPP): An active fluorescence approach was used to measure the efficiency with which phytoplankton in seawater samples convert sunlight to chemical energy, photosynthetic yield (Schreiber 1986, Kolber and Falkowski, 1993). Seawater samples were collected at multiple depths within the euphotic zone; each depth-specific sample was incubated for ~30 minutes in a single turnover active fluorescence instrument, LabSTAF. The instrument measures phytoplankton photosynthetic response parameters by varying light exposure during incubation. Measurements of above- and below-surface photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) were then applied to photosynthetic yield curves to estimate GPP.

This is a novel application of plankton productivity measurements in the Strait of Georgia. Similar measurements were carried out by Suchy et al. (2016) and Venello (2021) in Saanich Inlet and the West Coast of Vancouver Island, respectively, but direct estimates of TTE, applicable at ecosystem scales are otherwise rare. This multi-year, seasonally resolved TTE time series for coastal British Columbia is valuable to annual ecosystems assessment. TTE was variable on a seasonal basis, reflecting seasonal trends of both crustacean zooplankton and phytoplankton production rates and biomass. Although production rates for both groups was high in spring, upper water column TTE was typically low (< 10%) because phytoplankton production rates outpaced zooplankton rates. More efficient energy transfer was consistently measured in summer and fall. On an annual basis, TTE varied between 11.75-32.20%. Interannual variation was greater than variation between region-stations. Overall, TTE was greatest at the central station. Deep, basin-scale TTE was 17.14, 21.0, and 23.5% in 2023, 2024, and 2025. These estimates are in the top end of the Ware and Thomson (2005) range (10-20%) and comparable to 23% estimated by Sastri and Dower (2009) for the central Strait of Georgia in 2004 and 2005.

The information generated by these project activities provide ecosystem-relevant metrics of prey availability which are immediately applicable and currently used for statistical juvenile survival models (e.g. Perry et al. 2021 and the development and 'tuning' of biophysical numerical models (e.g. Pena et al. 2016, Olson et al. 2020). Observation-based validation of these approaches provides valuable reference for evaluating stock assessment forecasts.","This project provides detailed environmental information on prey availability and ecosystem function for a salmon life history stage particularly vulnerable to mortality. Data collected for this project is valuable because it integrates rate information about productivity at the base of the food web with state information about prey, type, quality, and availability. Continued application and regular improvement of the Perry et al. (2021 statistical models for juvenile Cowichan chinook and Big Qualicum coho can continue to be applied in support of DFO forecasting. The original model benefitted from high frequency collections, 2015-2018. This project extends the duration of this information-rich time series to 2025, potentially improving forecasting skill and supporting expansion to other salmonid populations reliant on the SoG as a nursery ground.

DFO adoption of the ecosystem approach to fisheries management (EAFM; Pepin et al. 2023) is currently under review. This approach aims to inform decision making based on traditional single stock assessments with information on climate, oceanographic conditions and predator-prey relationships. This project provided an opportunity to apply and explore the value of measuring lower trophic productivity and transfer efficiencies in keeping with EAFM principles. We have found that the ecosystem-level tools used in this project can be applied as part of a routine monitoring program. Moreover, we have found that rates of plankton production and how they influence resource availability, TTE, vary at temporal (monthly, seasonal, and annual) and spatial (local, region, basin) scales relevant to consumers of zooplankton. Critically, these measurement tools provide information at sea or else within days of sample collection, allowing for rapid assessment of ecosystem scale changes (e.g. early/late productivity events or unanticipated changes to plankton) relevant to fisheries management.",,"Figure 1.

Over the course of three years (2025 results are pending), the total number of Sockeye smolts estimated with SONAR when compared to estimates generated at the enumeration fence, ranged from 5-33% (5% in 2024, 8% in 2023, 33% in 2022).
This method has been shown to be effective at enumerating Sockeye smolts, which is an important and often lacking piece of information in salmon stock assessments (e.g. estimating early freshwater survival, generating stock-recruit relationships). However, using SONAR in this configuration is highly dependent on site selection, stream morphology, flow conditions, and the ability to adequately sample smolts for size measurements used in the analysis.","Chilko Sockeye salmon represent the only wild Sockeye indicator stock in the Fraser watershed. The annual Chilko Lake Sockeye smolt assessment (1951-present) comprises the only long-term time series data available to assess juvenile recruitment, and freshwater and marine productivity for wild Fraser River Sockeye salmon. Since program inception, Sockeye smolts have been enumerated during their out-migration from Chilko Lake using a traditional fish counting weir and photographic sampling/counting techniques. During the first six decades of the program (1951-2012), interruptions in weir operation were relatively rare: in only three years (1979, 1993, 2006) did early freshets necessitate removal of the weir before the vast majority of smolts had migrated from Chilko Lake.

Recently, unusually early freshets have been experienced in the Chilko watershed that have translated into high and variable water conditions much earlier in the season. As such, DFO Stock Assessment crews were not able to operate the weir in 2015 due to high water flows, and have had to remove the weir structure prior to the completion of smolt migration on numerous other recent years (e.g., 2019). The observed increase in the frequency of early freshets in the Chilko watershed is consistent with predicted hydrographic changes for interior BC streams as a whole in response to climate variability, with the average timing of the spring freshet expected to continue shifting earlier as air temperatures rise. The future of operating the Chilko Sockeye smolt weir is in jeopardy given the current trend related to the timing, frequency, and strength of the spring freshets. If proven effective, the SONAR method would provide an alternate assessment method for the Chilko watershed that could be quickly employed in years when high flows either prevent the installation of the weir at the beginning of the migration, or necessitate the removal of the weir before the smolt migration is largely complete.

The objective of this work was:
Test the feasibility of using upward-looking SONAR technology to assess daily abundances of Chilko Lake sockeye smolts as they migrate downstream through the Chilko River.
Evaluate the reliability of using daily SONAR-derived abundance indices predict the daily migration totals observed at the counting weir that is deployed annually on the Chilko River.

This work was conducted in collaboration with the Tŝilhqot'in National Government (TNG).","Acoustic data were collected with two Simrad WBT Mini SONAR systems deployed approximately 2 km downstream of the Chilko River smolt enumeration fence. Each SONAR system operated with a 7° circular 120 kHz split-beam transducer. For the up-looking system, the transducer was mounted on the river bottom, in the thalweg, aimed straight up towards the water surface. For the side-looking system, the transducer was mounted nearshore on the left bank of the river, with its center approximately 15 cm below the surface, aimed across the river with a transducer tilt angle of approximately 3° down from horizontal. Data were recorded with a ping rate of 20 pings per second on the up-looking (maximum range 4 m), 12 pings per s on the side-looking system (maximum range 12 m). Both systems were set to 50 W power output. For all four years of the study, SONAR data were collected from mid-April to late-May during the entire Chilko Sockeye smolt outmigration period.

SONAR data was manually reviewed and edited using Echoview software to remove noise, and echo integrated in 1 hour x 1 m range cells (side-looking) or 1 hour x 0.2 m range cells (up-looking). The results were exported as csv files, and all echo integration csv files belonging to the same transducer and site were concatenated for further analysis in Microsoft Excel. Excel was then used to convert the echo integration results to smolt passage estimates, which were then compared to the estimates generated at the Chilko River smolt enumeration fence.

In 2023 and 2024 (2025 results pending), daily estimates of smolt passage showed close correspondence (5% in 2023, 9% in 2024) between fence counts and independent acoustic estimates both in time and magnitude. In the first year of the study (2022), daily SONAR estimates were in good agreement with the fence counts over the first 9 days of the study, but consistently higher over the last 9 days (May 3rd and thereafter). At present, the source of this divergence is unclear.

This project is one of few that have used split-beam SONARs configured in this manner to enumerate outmigrating salmon smolts. While further testing needs to be conducted in both the Chilko River where the study was conducted, and in other candidate systems, the preliminary results of this study are promising. These methods could be modified and applied to a variety of salmon stock assessment programs to gain crucial information on survival in the early freshwater life stages (egg to smolt survival), however, considerable planning and care needs to be taken when selecting a suitable site.","This project has shown Sockeye salmon at the smolt life stage can be effectively enumerated using SONAR, and is an easily-deployed and operated alternative to installing large enumeration fences which are typically labor-intensive and may disturb stream substrates. Many salmon stocks are solely assessed through adult escapements, which does not capture survival during the early freshwater life stages, and creates additional challenges when investigating individual stock recruitment and forecasting returns that are used in fisheries management and planning.

Using SONAR to enumerate salmon at the smolt stage enables researchers to investigate survival metrics during the early freshwater period in which there is often little or no data at the population or Conservation Unit (CU) level. In systems where there is ongoing juvenile enumeration work (e.g. with counting fences, rotary screw traps (RST), incline plane traps (IPT), etc.), this method may provide a suitable, and less invasive alternative to conventional methods. Further to this, the observed increase in frequency of early freshets and hydrographic changes in response to climate variability may preclude the operation of some juvenile assessment methods, leading to the need for other means of collecting juvenile salmon data.

Sources of uncertainty raised from this project include discrepancies in SONAR counts when compared to fence counts (particularly in the 2022 study year), which at this time are unresolved. Additionally, there in uncertainty how the system deployed would operate under heavy flow conditions, in systems with different stream characteristics, and in systems with multiple species of Pacific salmon with overlapping outmigration timing.","This work describes how split-beam SONAR systems can be deployed and configured to enumerate outmigrating salmon smolts, which can provide crucial information on egg to smolt survival, stock recruitment, and freshwater habitat conditions and quality. This additional information can then be used to inform management strategies or mitigations for stocks below conservation benchmarks, or inform enhancement work conducted by the DFO Salmonid Enhancement program where no metrics exist other than adult escapements to evaluate performance (e.g. Bowron, Pitt, Taseko rivers).","Figure 1. 2024 daily estimates of Chilko River Sockeye smolt passage: side-looking SONAR estimates versus fence counts.

Fine temporal scale monitoring in nearshore coastal areas of Barkley Sound revealed year-long habitat use by juvenile salmon, with clear pulses in late Summer and early Fall.
These juvenile salmon densities are linked to densities and availability of euphausiids.
Competition and predation pressures from other fish species (Pacific herring and demersal predators like walleye pollock/Pacific hake) are present year-round and are found near surface water at night (co-occurring with juvenile salmon). Predation events from birds/marine mammals have been recorded multiple times at these sites, and did not appear to be density dependent.","Fisheries acoustics can be used to answer a number of questions related to Salmon ecology and dynamics. On large spatial scales, acoustic surveys are used to assess salmon prey (e.g forage fish and krill) conditions along the BC coast, identify prey hotspots, and assess changes in productivity through time. On a finer temporal scale, moored autonomous echosounders can provide information on juvenile salmon coastal habitat use, in conjunction with prey availability and predation pressures.

Autonomous echosounder system were used to address key elements affecting juvenile salmon during the first stage of marine life, including the timing of juvenile salmon use of coastal areas (time spent in key areas and within the water column), the prey conditions (e.g. euphausiids dynamic) they encounter in these areas, and the competition and predation pressures that affect them.","We used active acoustics methods as a remote sensing tools to assess the salmonsphere (salmon as well as their prey and predators). Large scale fisheries acoustic surveys conducted along the BC coast over the continental shelf and slope are used to assess marine conditions and the abundance and distribution of key prey species for adult Chinook salmon (e.g. Pacific herring and euphausiids). On a finer temporal scale, we used moored inverted echosounders to monitor juvenile salmons (and salmonsphere ecosystem components) in coastal areas within Barkley Sound.

Two autonomous systems were moored on the bottom of Barkley Sound nearshore areas with the transducers facing upward toward the sea surface, detecting juvenile salmon and all marine organisms as they go through the acoustic beam. Previous work in coastal areas using direct sampling methods (e.g. purse seine) combined with such moorings, as well as libraries of acoustic-trawl surveys and frequency-based signal processing techniques is enabling the classification of acoustic backscatter into species group (juvenile salmon, Pacific herring, walleye pollock and similar demersal fish, euphausiids) to obtain fine scale temporal data on their prevalence and relationship over more than a year of continuous data collection. In addition, surface predation events (from diving birds and/or marine mammals) are documented for the entire time-series. Acoustic methods are not capable of identifying juvenile salmon to species. To achieve species-specific interpretations the data will rely on other available sampling and ancillary data (seine, micro-trolling, eDNA, hatchery release timing) to further partition the acoustic information that was attributed to juvenile salmon.","Large spatial scale acoustic data have revealed persistent hotspots of euphausiids (a key salmon prey) along the BC coast - expansion of this work will include key forage fish species.

Moorings in nearshore coastal areas of Barkley Sound reveal the presence of juvenile salmon year-round, but having a clear pulse of activity and density in Late summer-early Fall. Although juvenile salmon have been detected throughout the top 50 m of the water column, they predominantly occupy the top 15-20 m of the water surface.

Pulses of juvenile salmon were closely linked to the availability and density of a key prey, euphausiids (krill). Krill display distinct diel vertical migrations (prey are at depth during the day and near surface at night).

Key competitors (Pacific herring) and fish predators (walleye pollock and/or Pacific hake) are present throughout the year, and also exhibit diel migration (mixing with juvenile salmon in the surface layer at night).

Further predation pressure from birds and/or marine mammals were identified throughout the time-series (documented daytime surface attacks), and does not appear to be density dependent, with many events occurring in the Winter when fewer surface schools are observed.","This study was implemented in the second year of PSSI. Acoustic data collected from moored systems are only available once instruments are recovered, in as such, we are just finalizing the processing and analyses of these acoustic data - integration with other sampling (micro-trolling, eDNA, etc) that occurred while the instrument were collecting data will be a critical step to fully interpret these data and publish the findings.","Figure 1. Typical echogram observed in Barkley Sound, where the top red band indicate the water surface, total depth displayed is around 80 m. a) dense juvenile salmon schools near the surface, b) typical herring schools, with one displaying the release of gas bubbles, c) demersal fish schools (likely walleye pollock within the deeper krill layer, d) example of a surface predation event, showing multiple animals/fish diving deep.",

Fine temporal scale monitoring in nearshore coastal areas of the Strait indicate low abundance of juvenile salmon compare to juvenile Pacific herring, suggesting high levels of competition for food.
The nearshore moorings (including cameras) revealed a wide array of potential predators for juvenile salmon, but surface predation from birds and/or marine mammals were not as frequent as observed in nearshore coastal areas of Barkley Sound.
Deeper mooring in the central Strait of Gorgia revealed that Pacific hake (predators) were present almost year-round.","Fisheries acoustics can be used to answer a number of questions related to Salmon ecology and dynamics.

Large scale fisheries acoustic surveys conducted within the Salish Sea are used to assess marine conditions and the abundance and distribution of key prey species and predators for salmon. On a finer temporal scale, we used moored inverted echosounders to monitor juvenile salmons (and salmonsphere ecosystem components) in nearshore habitats and within the larger Strait of Georgia basin.

This project used the same methods as described for project 2432. More specifically, two autonmous echosounders were moored on the bottom near Departure Bay and French Creek as part of a separate project focused on Pacific herring in 2022-2023. These data were re-analyzed to identify juvenile salmon and associated species. Another mooring was deployed in 2024 in the middle of the Strait of Georgia to assess ecosystem conditions in the deeper larger basin, to provide insight on the dynamic of key salmon prey species (euphausiids) and piscivorous predators (e.g. Pacific hake). Another echosounder mooring was deployed in Malaspina Strait in 2025 (but these data are not available yet).","Large spatial scale acoustic data have revealed an increasing biomass of Pacific Hake throughout the Strait, with likely increased predation pressure for juvenile salmon, a sharp contrast to the West Coast, where Pacific hake biomass has drastically dropped over the past years.

Moorings in nearshore coastal areas revealed the presence of juvenile salmon year-round, but in relatively low abundance. The nearshore habitat in the Salish Sea was largely dominated by Pacific herring (suggesting juvenile salmon are exposed to much higher competition for food).

Potential predators of juvenile salmon were observed routinely on the moored acoustics as well as on regularly moored camera systems. Surface predation from birds and/or marine mammals were also observed, but far less frequently than on the West Coast (Barkley Sound).

Moored autonomous echosounder in the central part of the Strait of Georgia further indicated that large predators (Pacific hake) were in the area for most of the year, and there was a strong seasonal signal of euphausiids and epi and mesopelagic communities in the Spring/Summer.","This study was implemented in the second year of PSSI. Acoustic data collected from moored systems are only available once instruments are recovered, in as such, we are just finalizing the processing and analyses of acoustic data from moorings deployed in 2024 and 2025.","Figure 1.

Despite the genotyping efforts, some areas in southern BC remain poorly resolved, with two areas being of particular interest: the lower Fraser and SOG. In the Fraser, the Albion test fishery, which provides crucial information on chum returns for stock assessment, relies on accurate separation of Chilliwack River returns from the rest of the Fraser, but it is currently challenging. To avoid misassignment and increase accuracy, albeit at the cost of resolution, all collections from the Fraser are lumped into a single reporting unit. In the Strait of Georgia, two main reporting units are currently recognized: Howe-Burrard, including collections from Howe Sound and Burrard Inlet; and Strait of Georgia, including collections from the west and east side of the strait that are not included in the Howe-Burrard reporting unit. Even though assignment accuracy between these two reporting units is low with the current SNP panel, the analysis of the baseline samples suggest that additional efforts may help discriminate collections from the east and the west side of the Strait, thus increasing overall resolution in the SOG.","We used whole genome sequencing to fully characterize genome-wide sequence variation within the Fraser, SOG and adjacent areas, including Puget Sound, Johnstone Strait, and West Coast Vancouver Island. We sequenced 15 individuals from each of 45 collections in these areas (Fig.1), and called variants using stringent quality filters. We identified more than 11 million SNPs (excluding rare variants) across 594 individuals, which is 21,000X the number of SNPs included in the current GSI panel (535 SNPs). We performed Principal Component Analyses (PCAs) to investigate population structure. Analyses based on 100,000 randomly selected SNPs, a subsample of the full catalogue of genomic variation, showed great resolution improvement compared to the reference baseline including data from the 535 SNPs of the GSI panel (Fig.2): the Fraser, SOG and Puget Sound were markedly differentiated from each other, the North Puget collections were clearly separated from the rest of the individuals, and we started to observe differentiation between Chilliwack and Fraser, and SOG east and west. More focused analyses including only Fraser-Chilliwack or SOG samples revealed significant differentiation within those two areas. To identify a set of highly informative SNPs to add to the GSI panel, we calculated FST, a measure of genetic differentiation, across all SNPs within each of the two areas and selected the 100 SNPs showing the highest differentiation in each area (Fraser and SOG).
We extracted the genotype data from the whole genome sequencing dataset for the SNPs in the GSI panel and the 200 highly differentiated SNPs in the Fraser and the SOG. 121 of the 535 SNPs in the GSI panel were not present in the whole genome dataset because they were either excluded due to quality and/or low minor allele frequency filters, or because they were not variable in the target geographic area. Using Leave-One-Out (LOO) analyses we tested for changes in GSI accuracy between the current GSI panel (414 SNPs) and the improved panel that includes the GSI panel and the 200 differentiated SNPs (614 SNPs). The addition of the 200 SNPs resulted in much improved assignments (Fig.3 and 4). When we tested the current GSI panel, assignments to the SOG had low true positive rates, indicating low assignment probabilities or misassignments, and individuals from each side of the strait showed similar probabilities to be assigned to SOG east or west (Fig.3). In the Fraser, Chilliwack individuals tended to be assigned to the rest of the Fraser, resulting in high false positive rate when the Fraser was the target reporting unit, and low true positive rates when the Chilliwack was the target reporting unit (Fig.3). In contrast, when we used the improved panel, all analyses showed low false discovery rate (FDR < 0.05) and high true discovery rate, hitting the target accuracy threshold of 80% of individuals assigned with 80% probability assignment, except for Chilliwack, which showed great improvement but fell slightly short on the true positive rate (70-75% instead of > 80%, Fig.4) . True positive rate of assignment to Chilliwack is likely to increase with greater sample sizes, which are generally targeted for the construction of the reference baseline. Overall, by adding 200 highly differentiated SNPs, true positive rate increased by 48% on average at a 80% of assignment probability threshold in the four target areas, with the greatest increases in Chilliwack (66%) and SOG west (63%), followed by SOG east (49%; Figs.3 and 4). The Fraser had the lowest increase in true positive rate as it was already high in the original GSI panel, even though its false discovery rate was the highest (10%) due to Chilliwack individuals tending to assign to the Fraser (Figs.3 and 4). Similarly, false discovery rate decreased by 5% and accuracy increased by 10% on average.
Finally, with funding from PSSI we expanded our whole genome dataset to include one collection from each designated Conservation Unit (CU) in BC and additional collections from Alaska, for a total of 512 individuals from 44 collections/CUs from Washington to Alaska. This dataset will be used to further characterize population structure across the BC range and beyond, investigate signatures of local adaptation and the environmental factors driving it, assess variation in genomic vulnerability to climate change across the NE Pacific range, estimate genetic diversity, reconstruct past changes in effective population size, and potentially further improve the GSI panel to increase geographic resolution of GSI.",,,"Figure 1.

Chum Salmon CNN predictive age models for the most common age classes have been very successful, attaining precision rates up to 94% (Ames et al. submitted CJFAS 2025). Fourier Transform-Near Infrared (FT-NIR) spectroscopy and Otolith Shape Analysis (OSA) have provided acceptable age predictions for Rougheye/Blackspotted (REBS complex), Yelloweye and Pacific Ocean Perch rockfish and have demonstrated excellent results for the REBS complex speciation and Yelloweye stock ID.
The steadily increasing demand for age data regularly exceeds program capacity, and with the SCL experiencing reductions in funding and skilled personnel, traditional age estimation has become a bottleneck in providing age data for the management of Pacific salmon. Automation of the age assignment process for salmon and rockfish species will facilitate increased capacity and supplement existing personnel providing key model age data to ensure fisheries are sustainably managed.","The SCL program provides approximately 120,000 quality controlled age-estimates for salmon and groundfish species annually. Age data are inputs in calculating rates of reproductivity, growth and mortality, critical components in stock productivity and are key parameters in stock assessment analyses. Provision of timely age data estimates enables downstream modelling of stocks performance and allow for these information to be available for consultation processes which are pivotal for sustainable fisheries management, conservation strategies and ecological research. The steadily increasing demand for age data regularly exceeds program capacity forcing requests to be aged on a prioritized basis, with the SCL experiencing reductions in funding and skilled personnel, traditional age estimation has become a bottleneck in providing age data for the management of Pacific salmon and groundfish (Malde et al. 2020).
Traditional techniques, such as scale and otolith age assignment are labour intensive, time consuming, and prone to inter-reader variability. Improved and accelerated age estimates through the deployment of an AI-driven pipeline of CNN and DML predictive age modeling will augment traditional ageing techniques and transform fish age estimation (Moen et al. 2023; Vabø et al. 2021).
A multiple agency effort (DFO, Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission (PSMFC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G) and the Northern Southeast Regional Aquaculture Association (NSRAA)) have developed working models to successfully predict Chum ages with an AI algorithm trained on 15,000 scale images. Although the existing models are coastwide (Alaska, BC and Washington), our research team is currently supplementing BC images to increase the robustness of the coastwide models while developing new models specific to Chum salmon captured in waters local to BC.
This is the first step in providing a multi-species Alternative Age Estimation pipeline designed to augment age assignment output capacity within the SCL.","For any AI predictive age model to function it requires input data or attributes, these are typically species and structure dependent. The SCL has focused on the attributes extracted from scales and otoliths for its investigations into predictive age assignment (Table 1).
In the case of salmon, specifically Chum the scale growth pattern is the attribute and a scale image is the means of interpretation (LaLanne and Safsten 1969; McNicol and MacLellan 2010). Chum salmon scales were collected by four agencies: NOAA, ADF&G, NSRAA and DFO. All groups prepare scales similarly for age estimation; scales are mounted to a gum card and acetate impressions are made. An automated high-speed Leica Emspira 3 mobile base camera system was used to selectively and rapidly image impressions of DFO Chum scales. CNN models were developed using 15,754 scale images; 24% of the total collection. Data were split into training (70%, n=11,012), validation (15%, n=2,365), and testing (15%, n=2,377) and randomly but stratified by age classes to ensure consistent age class distributions across each set. We deployed an ensemble of three CNN models architectures with a proven track record in their application for image classification and regression problems. The ensemble model of EfficientNetV2L, NASNetLarge, and ConvNeXtLarge provided excellent age predictions for the most common age classes of Chum recruiting to the fishery (Figure 1) (Ames, et al., In press).
In the case of groundfish, the otolith is the structure employed and its weight, shape morphometrics and Infrared spectral scan are the attributes. Together, the otolith morphometric attributes (weight, dimensional measurements, and shape outlines) and FT-NIR spectroscopic data (Benson et al. 2023) were used in machine learning algorithms in R to create predictive statistical models for species classification, stock delineation, and the automated age estimation of select rockfish species. Specifically, age estimation models of Rougheye, Yelloweye and Pacific Ocean perch provided estimates that met the lower acceptable precision rates set by quality control parameters for human generated precisions (Figure 2). Previously aged samples from the SCL Structure Library will be sourced, attribute data will be collected and incorporated into current models to increased the robustness of age predictions of these rockfish species.
The Alternative Age Estimation program has made great advancements in predictive age modeling based on key attributes of otoliths and scales with plans to apply these models to the most commonly aged species at the SCL.","Traditional age estimation methods rely on highly specialized skills developed through long-term mentorship, these methods are time-intensive and resource-heavy, limiting scalability and throughput. The steadily increasing demand for age data regularly exceeds program capacity forcing requests to be aged on a prioritized basis. While a significant amount of expertise is required to produce fish age estimates this is something AI can be trained to do. This modernization and the work to date establishes the groundwork for an AI-driven pipeline that augments traditional age estimation techniques, dramatically increasing efficiency while maintaining scientific rigor. Accurate and precise age estimation is pivotal for sustainable fisheries management, conservation strategies and ecological research.
Increased capacity benefits age-structured stock assessments that facilitate judicious fisheries resource management decisions commonly via science advice generated in CSAS processes which depend on high quality and consistent age-data. Commercial Fisheries programs are managed in partnership with stakeholders relying on scientific assessments and are dependent on consultative processes to develop and review policies, procedures and regulation.

SCL institutional ageing knowledge acquired over 40 years of ageing experience must be maintained to ensure predictive age assignments remain precise and do not drift as a result of environmental pressures such as climate change.","Model training, testing and validation will continue with previously aged samples in order to increase samples robustness of the three aforementioned rockfish species and Chum. New species (Chinook, Quillback Redbandded and Widow rockfish) are currently in the process of scale imaging, and otolith weighing, imaging and IR scanning. The overall goal is to create a image, weight and IR libraries of all species aged within the SCL age catalog. Model training, testing and validation will proceed on all species when enough structure attributes have been attained. This is the metadata foundation that will support age predictive AI age modeling.

Climate change, in the form of increasing water temperatures will diversely affect salmonid species causing variations in the physiological traits of growth and metabolic condition. Consequentially, driving a divergence from historical growth patterns causing interpretational difficulties that can result in the ""smearing"" of age classes. The creation of image based libraries has a two fold advantage; (1) it allows for automated predictive age assignments, and (2) it provides the ability to monitor changing growth rates by the direct measure of scale annuli. Measures of growth can provide information encompassing external environmental conditions as indicators of habitat quality, and internal physiological status of health, stress and reproductive state. The development of automated measures of annular growth are currently under investigation. As climate change becomes more prevalent the SCL expects that age requests will increase to compensate for the dynamic shifts in the ecosystem.

Current plans for operationalization of real-time age prediction of Chum salmon are underway. This will rely on a Frame Work laptop that is specifically design to run the Chum age predictive models and the SCL's high speed automated scale imaging camera. The series of events are as such;
scale images will be auto captured from the high speed camera,
an R-script will create image file names of species and specimen ID,
all other attribute metadata such as measure of scale growth will be extracted,
scale age will be predicted, recorded, and exported to the Mark and Recovery database.","Table 1. Represents the total number of structure attributes collected by species.

We found that survival is low during the downstream migration of sub-yearling Chinook in the spring and early summer. Disturbed rearing habitat, high water temperatures, and predation pressure from smallmouth bass were identified as the main threats to Okanagan Chinook juvenile survival. This new knowledge will help us target recovery efforts for this endangered population.","The Canadian Okanagan Chinook population is currently the only Columbia River basin Chinook population in Canada. Chinook escapements to the Okanagan River have been extremely low (less than 100 spawners annually) and many habitat challenges are preventing the recovery of the population. Okanagan Chinook were assessed as Endangered by COSEWIC in 2017, and the population is under review for listing under the Species at Risk Act. Some knowledge gaps that originated from those assessments were uncertainty around juvenile survival and factors influencing it.

To answer this knowledge gap, we partnered with Thompson Rivers University to support two graduate students to study factors influencing the survival of juvenile Chinook Salmon in the Okanagan River and Lake system. The project was also developed and implemented in collaboration with the Okanagan Nation Alliance's fisheries biologist Elinor McGrath.","Habitat use and survival:
Subyearling Chinook (n=547) raised in the kł cp̓əlk̓ stim̓ hatchery were implanted with ATS SS400 injectable acoustic transmitters. They were released in two groups, with group A (n=273) released in the Okanagan River below Vertical Drop Structure (VDS) 17 and above Vaseux Lake, and group B (n=274) released downstream of Vaseux lake below McIntyre Dam. A network of 15 ATS SR3001 autonomous receivers was deployed from Okanagan Falls to Osoyoos Lake between 21 May and 8 August, 2024). Receivers were clustered into 7 detection sites, placed to form acoustic ""gates"" at lake inlets and outlets, narrows and channel constrictions, and potential rearing/migration corridors. An ATS SR3017 mobile receiver with hydrophone was used to survey shallow side channels, deeper offshore areas beyond stationary coverage, and upstream and downstream of VDS structures. The proportion of fish detected decreased sharply for both release groups as fish migrated downstream, which translated to low survival in both release groups. Tag burden was not deemed a source of direct mortality, but could have increased susceptibility to predation.

Smallmouth bass diet and predation:
Targeted angling was conducted in the Okanagan River, Vaseux Lake, Osoyoos Lake from May 3 to August 7, 2024. The dominant species captured were smallmouth bass, which comprised 76% of the total catch (n=196), followed by Northern Pikeminnow (16%, n=41) and Yellow Perch (4%, n=11). There was a spatial shift in the distribution of smallmouth bass caught during the study. In May, less than half (45%) of smallmouth bass were caught at Vertical Drop Structures (VDS), but the proportion of smallmouth bass captured at VDS structures increased to 100% and 80% in June and July, respectively. Bass were observed utilizing rocky substrate and rip rap below the VDS structures to ambush prey. Diet content visual analysis was performed on a subsample of 73 of the total 196 smallmouth bass. A total of 162 fish stomach samples were sent for DNA barcode sequencing. Chinook salmon was only detected once in the DNA samples, but direct evidence of bass predation on juvenile Chinook was obtained by recovery of an acoustic tag used in the juvenile migration and habitat use study. DNA metabarcoding identified a diverse assemblage of 146 unique prey taxa. Aquatic insects (Diptera, Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera), invasive fish (smallmouth bass, yellow perch, common carp), and native fish (prickly sculpin, mountain whitefish, sockeye/kokanee, chinook) were the most common prey items in smallmouth bass stomach contents.","The research conducted through this project added greatly to the limited knowledge of juvenile Chinook survival in the Okanagan River and Lake system.

The acoustic telemetry study revealed that juvenile Chinook survival is low during their spring outmigration in the Okanagan River. It identified critical freshwater mortality hotspots in Vaseux Lake, in the Okanagan River, and in the northern portion of Osoyoos Lake. This mortality was associated with warm water temperatures and habitat constraints, and provides evidence for supporting habitat restoration strategies to increase juvenile survival. Proposed actions include:
Reconnecting side channels
Re-naturalizing riparian zones
Adding deep pools, woody debris, and cover
Managing macrophyte growth
Adjusting dam operations for cold water inflow protection
Adapting hatchery release strategy (timing and location) to maximize juvenile survival

The predation study revealed that predation pressure by native and invasive fish species, especially by smallmouth bass, is likely high and contributes to the low survival of juvenile Chinook in the Okanagan River and Lake system. It also identified predation hotspots at Vertical Drop Structure (VDS) sites on the Okanagan River. Proposed actions to mitigate the impacts of smallmouth bass predation include:
Reduce predation hotspots at VDS sites with restoration efforts to remove or modify existing structures
Targeted smallmouth bass removal in the Okanagan River and Lake system with electrofishing or angling programs
Protect and enhance rearing habitat for juvenile Chinook by supporting the habitat restoration strategies listed above","The findings from this project should be considered in the rebuilding and conservation plan of this endangered conservation unit, as it identified specific and tangible actions that have the potential to increase juvenile Chinook survival, productivity, and abundance of the CU.

Remaining knowledge gaps and recommendations for future studies include:
Using predator-detecting acoustic tags to determine juvenile mortality from predation and finer-scale movement data to elucidate habitat use throughout the migration corridor
Estimating the smallmouth bass population size in the Okanagan River and Lake system to quantify the predation pressure on juvenile Chinook
Understanding the role of predation from other native and invasive piscivorous fish and avian predators on juvenile Chinook survival","Figure 1: Proportion of acoustic tagged juvenile Chinook detected at downstream detections sites and resulting survival curves for release Group A (n= 273 upstream of Vaseux Lake) and B (n=274 downstream of McIntyre Dam). In both release groups, there is a sharp decline in the proportion of fish detected and survival is low during the downstream migration.

Key findings of this project indicate that the SMB population in Cultus Lake is expanding despite suppression efforts, and downstream movement through Sweltzer Creek towards the Vedder River has been detected at the DFO-operated juvenile enumeration fence. Biological samples have confirmed predation of SMB on juvenile salmonids and sculpin, confirming the potential risk on endangered Sockeye Salmon and Pygmy Sculpin, among other native species in the lake. Electrofishing has been shown to be extremely effective for suppression during the spring when SMB occupy near-shore habitat to build nests and spawn, however depths in which SMB occupy for most of the year (>20 feet) precludes their capture by electrofishing. In addition to SMB, the presence of Pumpkinseed, another non-native invasive species, was detected in Cultus Lake as part of this work. Since 2023, catch rates of Pumpkinseed while electrofishing have increased by ~1,200% indicating the population is rapidly expanding and poses a significant secondary risk to native species in the lake.
This project has highlighted the risk SMB (and also Pumpkinseed) pose both for native species within Cultus Lake, and in other areas of the Lower Fraser River if these populations continue to expand. Suppression efforts need to continue through time to both limit trophic effects within the lake, and downstream movement into the Fraser River through Sweltzer Creek.","Smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu), a piscivorous fish species native to eastern North America, have been introduced into Cultus Lake, British Columbia. Cultus Lake is home to endangered sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) as well as endemic Cultus pygmy sculpin (Cottus aleuticus). Smallmouth bass introduced in other salmon-bearing habitat have been observed to exert substantial mortality on salmon fry and smolts, suggesting a similar impact may be possible in Cultus Lake. Observations of sockeye salmon, and Cultus pygmy sculpin in the diet of captured smallmouth bass, demonstrates predation upon two native species at risk. While smallmouth bass represent a threat to the Cultus Lake native fish community and species at risk specifically, they are also highly valued by some anglers. Importantly, as a source population, they also represent a real and present threat to other ecosystems in the Lower Mainland. Smallmouth bass are often found in streams and rivers; in fact, they have already been found downstream of Cultus Lake. Additionally, there is the threat of anglers moving smallmouth bass to other waterbodies in the Lower Mainland to create new bass fisheries, which themselves would create risk to receiving environments. While there are largemouth bass (M. salmoides) populations in various waterbodies throughout the Lower Mainland, this is the first verified smallmouth bass population, and has drawn a lot of attention from the angling community. Early work on this population has identified a divergence of public opinions: some value native species (especially sockeye salmon) and want to see bass suppressed; other values angling opportunities for smallmouth bass and will strongly oppose any measures to affect this valued fishery resource.

There are two issues that this project addresses: (1) understanding which suppression options will result in the lowest opposition from anglers and community members, thereby identifying the risk of unintended consequences (e.g., additional transfers to other lakes); and (2) determining the suppression strategy (combination of different suppression options) which will best inform estimates of effectiveness for each suppression option so as to maximize effective suppression moving forward to reduce impacts on sockeye salmon recruitment.

This project was conducted in collaboration with the Province of British Columbia (Ministry of Water, Land and Resource Stewardship), and Simon Fraser University.","Electrofishing and angling was conducted in the spring to target SMB as they move to near-shore habitat to build nests and spawn. The perimeter of Cultus Lake was divided into quadrants (Figure 1) and swept with a boat electrofishing unit to target spawning SMB. In 2023, ten consecutive days of electrofishing were conducted (June 1-10, 2023), and all SMB captured (by electrofishing and angling) were implanted with a PIT tag and released to get an initial baseline of the population in 2024. A subset of SMB (n=25) were also implanted with acoustic transmitters to track movements within the lake, and downstream movement from the lake (acoustic receivers also deployed in 2023 in various locations). In 2024, two consecutive days (east side of lake day one; west side of lake day two) of electrofishing and angling were conducted for six consecutive weeks (May 9 - June 7, 2024), and all SMB were euthanized to get a PIT tag recovery sample and to see how the population responded to the cull the following year. In 2025, operations were conducted in two day intervals, for seven consecutive weeks (May 1 - June 13, 2025). For the first two weeks of the project all SMB were euthanized to reduce the spawning potential of the population, and for subsequent weeks 25% of all SMB were implanted with PIT tags and released. A subset of 44 SMB were also implanted with acoustic transmitters to track movements within, and from Cultus Lake. A total of 3,654 biological samples (length, weight (Figure 2); subset of stomach contents (Figure 3), scales, otoliths) were collected from SMB between 2023-2025. Of these samples, 268 stomach samples, 2,069 scale samples, and 20 otoliths samples were collected. Age analysis and acoustic tracking results are pending, and will be included in the final report (written by SFU).

Between 2023 and 2025, a total of 6,650 SMB were captured by a combination of electrofishing and angling (942 in 2023, 1,616 in 2024, 4,092 in 2025; 95% by electrofishing, 5% by angling). A total of 1,469 PIT tags were deployed (897 in 2023, 572 in 2025), and 69 acoustic tags were surgically implanted in SMB (25 in 2023, 44 in 2025). Of the PIT tags deployed in 2023, 47 were recaptured in 2024 (4.8% recovery) and 12 were recaptured in 2025 (1.2% recovery), giving a rough population estimate of approximately 16,000 SMB in 2024. However, observations from staff at the Cultus Lake Laboratory, the Province of BC, and anglers have indicated a significant portion of the population occupy habitat at depths that preclude SMB from capture by electrofishing, thus, this estimate is likely biased low. The PIT tags deployed in 2025 have yet to be captured in 2026, therefore a current population estimate is unavailable at this time. It should be noted that in 2023, a total of two Pumpkinseed were captured during the electrofishing program. In 2024 the number increased to 60, and in 2025 increased to 2,553. Further to this, the capture of Pumpkinseed was incidental as there is some overlap in habitat with SMB, and if efforts were targeted for Pumpkinseed (i.e. heavily vegetated near-shore habitat), those numbers would be higher. The rapid increase in Pumpkinseed bycatch over the course of this work is alarming and should be investigated in future years.

The subset of stomach samples taken, approximately 10% of samples contained juvenile salmonids (fry or smolt stage), and 2% contained sculpins. It is noted that many stomach samples were at an advanced stage of digestion therefore these estimates are biased low. Acoustic tracking of SMB is ongoing and will be discussed in the final report. However, between 2024 and 2025 a total of 17 SMB were captured at the DFO-operated smolt enumeration fence (run March - June annually), indicating some downstream movement of SMB in Sweltzer Creek to the Vedder River (tributary to the Fraser River). At this time there are no confirmed reports of SMB in the Vedder or Fraser rivers, however, as the population in Cultus Lake expands, downstream colonization is likely.

The following results, in addition to acoustic tracking data, an evaluation of suppression methods (paired with feedback from the public and social survey results), and up-to-date SMB population estimates will be presented in the final report written by SFU, DFO and the Province of BC in 2027.","This work has highlighted the Cultus Lake ecosystem is in peril with the introduction and expansion of not only SMB, but also Pumpkinseed, threatening two endangered species (Sockeye salmon and Pygmy sculpin) and a variety of other native pacific salmonid populations (Chinook, Coho. Chum, Pink, trout sp.). Cultus Lake is a unique ecosystem that is also one of the most popular recreational lakes in the lower Fraser watershed and concurrently faces other threats (e.g. eutrophication/water quality issues, invasive plant encroachment) that likely cumulatively impact native species within the lake, particularly those of conservation concern with severely depressed abundance. Further to this, the presence of SMB and Pumpkinseed in Cultus Lake threatens the entire lower Fraser watershed as downstream movement from this source population has already been detected at the DFO juvenile enumeration fence for two consecutive years (2024 and 2025).

Given the conservation concerns for Sockeye salmon and Pygmy sculpin (both Red status under SARA), management decisions and mitigation planning should place a great emphasis on long-term suppression of SMB and Pumpkinseed to reduce the immediate predation impacts on native species, in addition to other cumulative threats such as habitat degradation from invasive plants and water quality issues that will inevitably lead to trophic effects within Cultus Lake.","Sources of uncertainty and recommendations raised from this work include:
The total population size of SMB in Cultus Lake is currently unknown, given a portion of the population occupies habitat that precludes capture by electrofishing. Future work should explore alternative methods of capture (e.g. increased angler effort, spearfishing, trapping) to target this portion of the population.
The degree of SMB predation on endangered Sockeye Salmon and Pygmy Sculpin is unclear as many samples were at an advanced stage of digestion and were not analyzed for DNA. Future work should include a more thorough analysis of SMB gut contents to inform conservation measures for these species.
The rapid increase in Pumpkinseed bycatch (1 in 2023, to 2,553 in 2025) over the course of this work is alarming, and further work is needed to determine critical habitat within Cultus Lake, the source population (natural reproduction vs. continued introductions), and a suppression plan created to limit further expansion.

This work has shown electrofishing to be an effective tool for SMB management, in addition to other invasive species that occupy near-shore habitat year-round or during their spawning period (e.g. bass, northern pike, pumpkinseed, crappie, perch, etc.). Electrofishing could be expanded into other areas of the lower Fraser River (e.g. sloughs, side channels, etc. to target other persistent populations of invasive species such as largemouth bass, sunfish sp., bullhead sp., perch, among others) and other areas of the watershed that house invasive species (e.g. Nicola Lake yellow perch, Pitt Lake largemouth bass).",,

Molecular tools allow the detection of pathogens, disease, stress, and smoltification from minimally invasive gill biopsies via salmon Fit-Chips. Further, non-invasive e(nvironmental)RNA is able to detect infectious agents and stress on population level from water samples. Together, these tools may allow for proactive and adaptive fish health management to improve hatchery operations.","The DFO salmon enhancement program (SEP) is undergoing a modernization process to improve hatchery effectiveness. Specifically, an increased focus is being placed on conservation-based hatcheries. Modernized practices aim to produce high quality rather than quantity of smolts and try to minimize husbandry practices associated with elevated stress or pathogen exposure. One intention is to minimize pathogen infections to reduce transmission risks to wild stocks, fostering better conservation outcomes. Smolt readiness is often critical to survival of hatchery releases, but conventional assessment is invasive, expensive, and slow. Novel molecular tools offer attractive avenues to assess the effectiveness of many of the SEP modernization goals and inform scientifically defensible hatchery operations. To achieve proactive and adaptive management, molecular data can monitor the effects of husbandry, mortality, and treatment in near real-time. In this project we aim to provide near real-time health monitoring based on gill tissue biopsies as well as eRNA through deploying salmon Fit-Chips in collaboration with the following SEP hatcheries: Nitinat River, Robertson Creek, Chehalis River, Tenderfoot creek, Puntledge River, Rosewall Creek.","Main methods used: Nucleic acids were extracted from salmon gill biopsies collected from hatchery cohorts and were run on the Fluidigm Biomark nanofluidic qPCR platform. Within a single analytical run, this platform allows for assays of 20 infectious agents and 58 salmon genes to be run against 80 gill samples. The salmon gene expression can be statistically analyzed to provide probabilities (0-1) for certain salmon ""stressor states"" including: food deprivation, imminent mortality, viral disease, smoltification, hypoxia, inflammation, and immune stimulation. Detailed methods for the Fit-Chip laboratory and statistical analysis can be found in Akbarzadeh et al. (2024). Salmon Fit-Chips were also used to analyze the nucleic acids extracted from water filtered at the hatcheries known as e(nvironmental)RNA. Crucially this approach allows for the detection of live pathogens present in the water around the fish or in the hatchery water source, acting as an early warning signal for pathogen exposure and infection. Similar to the stress assessment gill biopsies with Fit-Chips, using the relative ratios of salmon RNAs in the water can inform the stress status of a hatchery cohort on the group level, for instance detecting if fish are mounting an antiviral response indicative of viral infection, suffering from stress such as high temperatures or hypoxia, or if fish are getting ready for the transition to saltwater (smoltification), which dictates the optimal release date from the hatchery. Exploring the use of eRNA by comparing the results of cohort eRNA Fit-Chips results with the stress and pathogen signature of individuals within the cohort was a key objective of the initial phase of the project as it holds great promise for stocks of conservation concern due to the ability to monitor cohort health non-invasively.

Advancements in methodology, technology, and application/Products and tools produced: eRNA salmon Fit-Chips were refined for the non-invasive monitoring of hatchery cohorts. Specifically, pathogens could be assessed effectively while cohort level hypoxia and temperature stress measurements showed promising results in the eRNA Fit-Chips. Other parts of the eRNA Fit-Chips require additional research and development to streamline procedures and reduce variability.

Advancements in communication and knowledge transfer: An automated reporting pipeline was developed to classify Fit-Chip data and produce figures which streamlined data analysis and reporting, providing managers with expedited fish health metrics. While the reporting was not in real-time, this project did provide in season reporting and future iterations of the project would need to address the obstacles to real-time reporting identified throughout the project.

Key results and information generated: Fit-Chip data from eRNA and tissues provide useful information for hatchery managers, making them a promising tool for the future. Specifically, we demonstrate that Fit-Chips can ...
efficiently track pathogen prevalence and load in fish tissues and eRNA water samples (Figure 1 and 2).
document pathogen exposure from source waters and cohort tanks across the entire rearing period (Figure 1-3)
document smoltification progression from gill biopsies which could be used to optimize release timing (Figure 4).
detect viral disease development signals in gill biopsies associated with known viruses and led to the discovery of a novel virus where no known viruses were detected (Figure 5)
detect specific stressors simultaneously from eRNA and gill biopsies (Figure 6)","With this project we demonstrate the utility of salmon Fit-Chips for proactive hatchery management through individual level gill biopsies as well as on cohort level through eRNA from water samples. Our data:
Identifies source water the occasional origin of pathogen exposure and infections (Figure 3)
Documents several instances of pathogen detections in water prior to detections in tissues (Figure 2)
Identifies changes in water properties as the likely source of stress (Figure 6)
Demonstrates that 30% of the mortalities at Chehalis (Maria Slough Chinook) displayed a food deprivation signature as well as low weight to length ratio, suggesting that the fish had ceased feeding weeks prior to their death.
Documents that smoltification status at release varied substantially between years (Figure 4)
Documents the association of viral disease development (VDD) signature with known viruses (Figure 5)
Identified a novel Influenza B-like virus associated with VDD positive fish of unknown impact (Figure 5)
This project informs salmon management by
Providing an early warning tool for pathogen and stress monitoring from non-invasive eDNA/eRNA samples of specific interest for stocks of conservation concern. This has generated substantial discussion with managers at Tenderfoot Creek hatchery.
Documenting the effects of water source on pathogen levels and highlighting pathogen vs imprinting tradeoffs:
River water → higher pathogen loads early
Well water → lower early infections but spikes when switched to mixed water
Continuous mixed water → lowest stable pathogen levels.
Monitoring smoltification progress over the rearing season, demonstrating that this approach could be used to inform release timing decisions
Monitoring pathogen abundance in source water to, demonstrating that this approach could be used to inform decisions to shift to new water sources
Providing a single tool to assess multiple stressors cumulatively impacting hatchery reared fish
Providing a baseline of cohort health against which to evaluate future return success to identify key factors impacting post release survival
Areas of uncertainty remain in
Addressing the sampling artifact(s) and/or the causes of mismatch in the smoltification, VDD, and imminent mortality panels assessed by eRNA and gill biopsy Fit-Chips
The impact of the two observed high prevalence viruses PsNV and InfB for which no formal pathogenicity data is available","Future optimization for Fit-Chip monitoring of hatchery cohorts will focus on the following:
Automated eRNA sampling systems installed on rearing tubs to alleviate the burden of sampling and permit more frequent sampling events.
Improved sample handling and laboratory processing
Tailored reporting to operational needs of specific hatcheries.
The data from this pilot project could be integrated into salmon conservation management by:
Integrating molecular data as a standard in hatchery management practices
Integrate the hatchery database with the molecular reporting pipeline to improve results turnaround.
Considering the impacts of microbes and pathogens, both positive and negative, within the natal systems for salmon conservation hatcheries. For example, rearing in surface waters may result in increased survival despite (Harstad et al., 2018).",,"Akbarzadeh A, Ming TJ, Schulze AD, Kaukinen KH, Li S, Gunther OP, Houde ALS, Miller KM (2024) ""Developing molecular classifiers to detect environmental stressors, smolt stages and morbidity in coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch.""

This project builds on our earlier 6PPD-Q field program which characterized the presence 6PP-Q at 34 sites in salmon bearing creeks in the greater Vancouver area, Squamish and Vancouver Island before, during, and after rain events. The sample collection has been carried out with help from several ENGOs, First Nations, and University partners. Key findings include:
78% of the sites monitored during wet weather events have concentrations that exceed lethal threshold values for coho salmon.
Positive associations were observed between 6PPD-Q and residential cover and commercial cover, as well as environmental data including turbidity and the number of dry days prior to flow.
Water sample 6PPD-Q concentrations during rain events were strongly correlated with copper and zinc, all of which were found to exceed water quality guidelines in urban and semi-urban areas.
Temporal monitoring indicated that during baseflow conditions, concentrations never exceeded water quality guidelines, but following any sustained rainfall streams failed water quality guidelines and usually surpassed published toxicity thresholds published for juvenile coho salmon and coastal cutthroat trout. Every monitoring period saw multi-hour periods (e.g. 4-19 hours) of 6PPD-Q which exceeded lethal thresholds for coho salmon. Collectively, this suggests a widespread toxicity hazard exists for coho salmon and related salmonid taxa in urban streams.

This project has delivered new data on 6PPD-Q levels in salmon bearing creeks in coastal British Columbia and is being used in the reassessment of 6PPDQ, the parent compound of 6PPD-Q, under the Canadian Environmental Protections Act (CEPA). This study is providing information to PSSI and fisheries managers as they aim to curb historic declines in Pacific salmon, particularly coho salmon which are highly sensitive to this chemical and enable their recovery.",,"Field collections: A total of 2,118 stream water samples from salmon bearing streams, 27 road runoff samples, and 54 laboratory methods development and validation test water samples were collected and analyzed for 6PPD-Q.

Analytical Methods: 6PPD-Q in unfiltered water samples was quantified using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with an Agilent 1290 Infinity II UPLC system and a Sciex triple-quadrupole API5000 mass spectrometer equipped with a Turbo V Ion source. Water samples spiked with an internal standard (99% phenyl 13C6 6PPD-Q, ACP Chemical Inc.) were analyzed either directly after dilution or after solid-phase extraction.

Key Findings:
78% of the sites monitored during wet weather events have concentrations that exceed LC50 values for coho salmon (Lethal Concentration at which 50% of a test population dies).
Continual temporal monitoring revealed that 6PPD-Q concentrations exceeded the LC50 reported for juvenile coho salmon by up to 6-fold, with exceedances lasting from 4 to 19 hours during rain events
Salmon habitat in urban and semi urban areas across southern B.C. is subject to repeated pulses of 6PPD-Q, as well as other toxic chemicals (e.g., copper and zinc) over the course of the wet season that expose coho salmon to toxic concentrations for considerable periods.","We have characterized 6PPD-Q contaminant concentrations and risks in nearly 100 salmon bearing creeks in southern British Columbia. Our results indicate a high risk of lethality for coho salmon and coastal cutthroat trout during wet weather events in streams located in semi-urban and urban areas.
Management questions addressed by this project include those related to understanding and mitigating an identified stressor (i.e., 6PPD-Q) on at-risk salmon species and populations.
The findings from our project will directly inform regulatory risk assessments, as well as cumulative risk assessments led by resource managers, as well as other organizations, which will explicitly consider the combined fate and effects of a myriad of stressors for salmon (i.e. contaminants, climate change, habitat destruction, overharvesting, etc.). These findings will also enable a comprehensive understanding of the contribution that 6PPD-Q directly plays in the population level declines of coho salmon, as well as indirectly for other pacific salmonids, and key predators (e.g., at-risk Resident killer whales).
This cumulative information will be incorporated into developing recommendations for measures that will address contaminants affecting salmon and their habitat. In addition, it will inform coho salmon recovery plans for COSEWIC- and ESA-listed populations. Ultimately, decisions that regulate the release of 6PPD-Q and other priority contaminants of concern to salmon and other aquatic coastal wildlife can then be considered for source control, reduction or elimination measures.","Completion of the predictive hot spot map for 6PPD-Q is underway and will be completed prior to March 31, 2026. This map will aid in identifying priority areas for monitoring this toxic chemical as well as identifying priority areas for the installation of environmental engineering initiatives.
This information will be used to enable regional authorities (e.g. Metro Vancouver) and municipalities to make informed decisions around effective mitigation strategies on non-point source releases into high priority areas. This will have a positive effect as the findings will inform on road runoff discharges of contaminants into the habitat of hundreds, if not thousands of distinct salmonid populations, including coho, Chinook, sockeye, chum, pink, steelhead trout, and coastal cutthroat trout. Even more broadly, this information is likely to be relevant to potential road runoff exposure and associated impacts that other aquatic species may be experiencing both nationally and internationally in urban watersheds.
At least five additional rain garden sites will be selected, aiming for a minimum of three rain event sample collection per site. In addition, soil microbial communities will be evaluated across the selected rain garden sites.","Figure 1.

12 contaminant classes were analyzed in two composite samples collected in 2022 from Barkley Sound (completed) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and metals were analysed in individual fish collected in 2023 and 2024 in Clayoquot Sound and Barkley Sound (in progress).
Metals, PAHs, and PCBs were the top three contaminant classes detected with the highest concentrations in the two composite samples from Barkley Sound.
Comparing our results to established effects thresholds, juvenile Chinook salmon from Barkley Sound may be at low risk of exposure to contaminants, specifically PCBs, PBDEs, Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), PAHs and mercury.
Concentrations of contaminant classes measured in WCVI juvenile Chinook Salmon range from 3 to 100x lower than levels of contaminant classes documented in juvenile Chinook in the Fraser River. As such contaminant levels in WCVI juvenile provide a benchmark of 'lower' levels reflecting lower urban and industrial associated sources.","The marine environment is under significant anthropogenic pressures including overfishing, habitat degradation shipping, climate change and contaminants (Quinn, 2018). Although declines in Chinook salmon abundance are thought to be linked to freshwater, estuarine and marine environmental conditions, contaminants may also play a role, especially exposure to contaminants during their early life stage. For example, exposure to contaminants in freshwater and/or estuaries have been shown to impact growth and survival of juvenile Chinook salmon (Lundin et al., 2019, 2023; Zabel et al., 2004; Meador et al., 2014).
A variety of contaminants have been detected in adult Chinook salmon collected from the West Coast of Vancouver Island (WCVI) (Holbert et al., 2024). Some of the highest concentrations (on a lipid weight basis) of alkylphenols (APs), total hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), short chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs) and medium-chain chlorinated paraffins (MCCPs) have also been measured in WCVI adult Chinook relative to other stocks (Brown and Holbert, unpublished data). Juvenile salmon are exposed to a variety of contaminants during their seaward migration depending on the characteristics and anthropogenic activities of the watershed. In their study of hatchery-reared Chinook salmon, Meador et al. (2014) found that individuals transiting through contaminated estuaries had a survival rate that was 45% lower than for those transiting through uncontaminated estuaries. To better characterize contaminant levels and evaluate their potential impacts on the health of juvenile Chinook, we collected juvenile Chinook salmon throughout Barkley Sound on the WCVI in July 2022 to evaluate the levels of over 700 compounds from 12 different contaminant classes. In addition, PCBs, PAHs and metals were analysed in individual fish collected in 2023 and 2024 in Clayoquot Sound and Barkley Sound. This project was conducted in partnership with the Follow the Fish program.","Field collections:
2022: In 2022, the FtF program carried out purse seine surveys to catch and sample juvenile Chinook in the nearshore marine waters of Barkley Sound. Whole fish were frozen in the field using liquid nitrogen and sent to the Pacific Science Enterprise Center, West Vancouver, BC, where they were stored at -80 until further analyses.

2023/2024: In 2023/2024, the FtF program carried out microtrolling surveys to catch juvenile Chinook during their first winter at sea. Surveys were conducted in various sounds along the West Coast of Vancouver Island and we received samples from Barkley Sound (n=19) and Clayoquot Sound (n=30) that were collected between October 2023 and March 2024. In addition, we received samples from the purse seine surveys conducted in Barkley Sound in August (n=16) and September 2024 (n=22). As for the 2022 samples, the subset of captured juvenile Chinook salmon retained were euthanized and had their fork lengths measured and a fin clip taken for genetic stock identification. Samples were frozen in the field and sent to the Pacific Science Enterprise Center, West Vancouver, BC, where they were stored at -80 until further analyses.

Analytical methods:
Samples: In 2022, fish were pooled into two composite samples to have enough material to conduct the analyses of 12 different contaminant classes.
In 2023 and 2024, a muscle subsample from each individual fish was analyzed.

Genetic Stock identification: Fin clips collected in the field were sent to the Molecular Genetics Lab to determine stock of origin of fish using genetic stock identification (GSI) and parentage-based tagging (PBT) methods (Beacham et al., 2018).

Contaminants:
Samples from 2022 were analyzed for 12 different contaminant classes: legacy and current use pesticides using high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) using HRMS, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) using HRMS, dioxins and furans using HRMS, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS), pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) using LC-MS/MS, alkylphenols using GC/MS, hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD)using LC-MS/MS, polychlorinated paraffins using GC/MS, brominated and chlorinated flame retardants using GC/MS metals using inductively coupled plasma collision reaction cell mass spectrometry (CRC-ICPMS) and mercury using Cold Vapor Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (CVAAS). All analyses, except metals and mercury which were conducted at ALS Canada Ltd., Burnaby, were conducted at SGS AXYS Analytical Ltd., Sidney, B.C. Samples were run alongside reference samples and blanks to evaluate method performance.
While all samples from 2023 (n=19) and 2024 (n=60) were analyzed for metals and mercury at ALS, a subset was run for PAHs (n=8 and n=16, respectively) and PCBs (n=8 and n=9, respectively) at SGS AXYS.

Stable isotopes: Samples were analyzed for carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes at the Freshwater Institute Biotracers Laboratory as described in Rosenberg et al. (2015). Briefly, subsamples were freeze dried and one mg of sample was loaded into tin capsules and analyzed using a Thermo Advantage V Plus continuous flow Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer coupled with a Costech 4010 Elemental Analyzer.

Collaborative Analyses:
Otolith microchemistry: Otoliths were collected from the fish sampled and polished to prepare them for microchemical analysis using a laser and a mass spectrometer, called LA-ICP-MS, or 'Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry'. Results of this analysis show how concentrations of elements change in a fish during its entire life and help understand fish growth as well as differentiate between periods spent in the freshwater vs saltwater. This information can provide helpful life history information that can help interpret contaminant concentrations observed in juvenile fish.
Biotoxins: In addition to chemical pollutants, juvenile Chinook are also exposed to biological contaminants such as biotoxins, poisonous chemicals produced naturally by certain types of marine phytoplankton. A subset of the fish analyzed in 2023 and 2024 were also analyzed for biotoxins by the DFO biotoxin team (Institute of Ocean Sciences). Together with information on chemical pollutants, it will provide a fuller picture of contaminant exposure in these juvenile fish.

Transcriptomics: RNA is being extracted from liver samples from the 2023 and 2024 fish for which we have matching contaminant data. Briefly, tissues are being homogenized with TRIzol reagent and a 3 mm diameter tungsten-carbide bead using a mixer mill. Isolated total RNA is being resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated distilled deionized water (DEPC) and stored at -80°C. RNA concentrations are being confirmed through spectrophotometry and 1 µg of each sample is being used to produce cDNA with the High Capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems).
In addition to three normalizer genes (ribosomal protein L8, beta actin and Coil domain-containing protein 84), we are looking at genes known to be impacted by contaminants (aryl hydrocarbon receptor, cytochrome p450, estrogen receptor and vitttelogenin) as well as genes markers of stress response (catalase, heat shock protein 27 and metallothionein).

Key Findings:
In the 2022 juvenile fish from Barkley Sound, metals, PCBs and PAHs were the top three contaminants with the highest concentrations out of the 12 contaminant classes analyzed (Figure 1).
Overall, the levels of contaminants were generally lower than those reported in previous studies which were conducted mostly in more urban areas like Puget Sound, WA, and Oregon (O'Neil et al., 2020; Anzalone et al., 2022; Lundin et al., 2021; Figure 2) aligning with the fact that the West Coast of Vancouver Island is relatively remote from any major urban or industrial centers.
A recent study (Lo, 2026) has enabled comparison with juvenile chinook from Harrison stock collected from the Fraser River at an earlier life stage (March to June) and small size class (ranging from 0.3 to 4.8g) for comparison. Relative to contaminants measured in juvenile Chinook from Barkley Sound in July 2022, the levels of contaminants in Fraser River juveniles were higher for example, levels of PCBs were up to 6x higher, PPCPs were nearly 100x higher, Alkylphenols were approximately 20x higher, and pesticides approximately 10x higher with PFAS and PBDEs approximately 3x higher (Lo, 2026).
When comparing WCVI Robertson Creek juvenile Chinook concentrations to established effects threshold concentrations for contaminants (PCBs, PBDEs, DDT PAHs and mercury) and in fish (Meador et al., 2002; Berninger and Tillit, 2019; Arkoosh et al., 2017; O'Neill et al., 2015; Beckvar et al., 2005; Johnson et al., 2007), they are below all thresholds and therefore are likely at low risk contaminant associated effects due to these particular contaminants. Even though all fish collected in 2022 were collected at the same time within Barkley Sound, some differences in concentrations and patterns for some contaminants were observed between the two composite samples and may reflect variability of contaminant exposure related to the locations where they were collected in Barkley Sound or variability amongst individuals selected for each of the composite (influence of size).
Preliminary results from 2023 and 2024 support this conclusion as monthly variability were observed in mercury concentrations and levels were correlated with length (Figures 3 and 4).","We have characterized, for the first time, contaminant concentrations in juvenile Chinook salmon from the West Coast of Vancouver Island. Our results indicate a low risk of contaminant associated health impacts for certain compounds and contaminant classes. However, while concentrations in WCVI juvenile Chinook are lower relative to other regions in B.C. and Washington State, it remains important to evaluate contaminant associated risks in juvenile Chinook inhabiting these waters.
Management questions addressed by this project include those related to understanding and mitigating a significant stressor (i.e., contaminants) on at-risk salmon populations. Similarly, the recovery of Endangered Southern Resident killer whales and Threatened Northern Resident killer whales requires identifying and mitigating the significant threat posed by contaminants, and largely delivered via their priority prey, Chinook salmon.","Interpretation of the contaminant results for the 2023, 2024 samples.
Combine contaminant dataset with transcriptomic dataset to evaluate the impacts of contamination, both chemical and biological (biotoxins) on the health of juvenile Chinook salmon.
Interpretation with contaminated juvenile chinook from the Harrison stock collected from the Fraser River (Lo, 2026), that reflect exposure to sources in highly urbanized and industrialized habitats
Finding from our study may provide benchmarks for low contaminant levels and an associated no to low effects that other managed areas need to strive towards, in particular providing contextual comparisons to the Fraser River stocks.","Figure 1: Total concentrations (ng/g wet weight (ww)) of each contaminant class analyzed in the two juvenile Robertson Creek Chinook salmon composite samples collected in 2022 ranked from highest to lowest. * indicates contaminants not detected

Key Findings: Analysis of 196 federal and provincial statutes revealed that pollution-related provisions are most prevalent across both jurisdictions. Salmon harvest regulation is mostly managed federally, while salmon habitat factors including water use and watercourse modifications are governed provincially, which reflects a structural disconnect between fish stock stewardship and habitat protection.

Implications: The LAPSE framework demonstrates the ability to identify regulatory pathways relevant to specific human activity threats by linking IUCN-CMP threat classifications to legislation, enabling salmon stewardship practitioners to navigate the complex legal landscape and develop coordinated, inter-jurisdictional recovery strategies.","Pacific salmon populations across British Columbia are experiencing widespread declines driven by multiple anthropogenic stressors including habitat degradation, climate change, and overharvest. The governance landscape for Pacific salmon is highly fragmented, with federal jurisdiction over harvest intersecting with provincial authority over freshwater habitat, creating regulatory complexity that impedes effective stewardship. This decentralized, multi-sector array of constitutional authority stems from Canada's adaptation of British Common Law and creates overlapping responsibilities where jurisdictional authority is rarely the responsibility of one level of government. The patchwork is particularly prominent in Pacific salmon management due to their anadromous life cycles spanning international boundaries, as well as, freshwater and marine ecosystems. While salmon populations and fisheries are regulated federally, water use and watercourse alterations affecting aquatic habitat are managed provincially, with both governments having authority to designate protected areas. British Columbia is even more decentralized than other provinces, with species at risk provisions spread over the greatest number of statutes and regulations.

Addressing threats to salmon habitat requires coordinated, inter-jurisdictional action across multiple departments. Freshwater habitat impacts from forestry, agriculture, and urbanization act cumulatively and compound with climate change to degrade salmon watersheds. For example, pollution-related terms appear in 18 federal acts and 22 provincial acts, with implementation responsibilities spanning eight federal ministries and nine provincial ministries. Despite considerable attention toward policies and recovery programs (e.g., Canada's Policy for Conservation of Wild Pacific Salmon and the Pacific Salmon Strategy Initiative), Pacific salmon populations continue to decline while the number of monitored populations decreases. Assessment frameworks like the ""IUCN-CMP Direct Threats Classification"" have been developed to evaluate anthropogenic activities and limiting factors, but a key challenge is identifying actions that are both impactful and feasible across the wide geographic range and diverse life history of Pacific salmon. Dispersed authority, regulatory complexities, ambiguous responsibilities, and unclear management objectives across jurisdictions become barriers to effective and timely action.","The LAPSE process and framework was developed as a collaborative effort to decode the complexity between threats to salmon and corresponding environmental legislation by creating an interface between regulatory language and anthropogenic threat categories. We accumulated 196 Canadian federal and British Columbian provincial statutes (including acts, regulations, codes, and orders) relevant to Pacific salmon stewardship through a systematic keyword search process using the Canadian Legal Information Institute (CanLII) website. Indigenous legislation, Yukon Territorial legislation, municipal bylaws, and international conventions were not included due to scope limitations, though these may overlap with federal or provincial legislation.

The methodology involved parsing legislation by individual clauses (paragraphs) using automated HTML extraction, then developing a keyword-matching process that assigns clauses to ""management domains,"" defined as discrete areas of administrative concern (aligned with the IUCN-CMP Direct Threats Classification). The parsed legislation was stored in a SQLite database with datatables including jurisdiction, act name, legislation type, paragraph content, section, heading, management domain, IUCN-CMP threat category, scope, and matched keywords. Keyword lists were derived from IUCN-CMP threat definitions, word frequency analyses of collected legislation, and iterative researcher input and revision to ensure specificity and relevance.

Clauses were categorized by salmon-specific scope ranging from direct salmon references to general governance: ""1 - Salmon"" (Pacific salmon specifically); ""2 - Fish"" (fish including salmon); ""3 - Habitat"" (habitat including salmon habitat); and ""4 - Governance"" (administrative processes and structure). Additionally, clauses were categorized by type (prohibition, authorization, designation, etc.) to understand the nature and intent of legislative provisions. The management domain categories were aligned with IUCN-CMP Level 2 threat categories, though some lumping and splitting was required to better match with sector-by-sector Canadian and British Columbian legislation.

Key findings revealed that pollution was the management domain with the highest section count, split almost evenly between federal and provincial jurisdictions. Fisheries was among the top three section counts with a majority under federal jurisdiction, while Water Use and Watercourse Modifications was in the top four with a majority under provincial jurisdiction--indicating an underlying disconnect where salmon harvest is controlled federally while habitat aspects are governed provincially. The IUCN-CMP Level 2 threat category ""9.1 Water-Borne & Other Effluent Pollution"" matched with the highest number of sections, followed by ""5.4 Fishing, Harvesting & Controlling Aquatic Species."" Pacific salmon-specific language was found in far fewer sections than indirect, less specific language, with more federal legislation sections matching salmon harvest categories than provincial.","The LAPSE framework adds significant knowledge to understanding the legislative architecture governing Pacific salmon populations, health, and ecosystems. By systematically parsing and categorizing legislation according to management domains and IUCN-CMP threat classifications, the tool provides unprecedented navigability of the legal landscape for practitioners. The analysis reveals structural patterns in how threats are addressed across jurisdictions and the factors that create coordination challenges for integrated salmon stewardship.

The framework could inform salmon management decisions, policy guidance, and planning by providing accessible pathways to identify which statutes, regulations, and specific clauses are relevant to particular threats affecting salmon populations. Our case studies demonstrated the tool's utility: for ""10.1 Geological Events"" (landslides), the framework identified eight pieces of legislation largely related to forestry, revealing that clauses were mostly ""Instruction"" and ""Designation"" types. For ""7.2 Dams & Water Management / Use"" (identified as Extreme-High threat for Fraser Interior Chinook), the framework revealed extensive legislation with more evenly distributed clause types, with ""Interpretation & Purpose"" and definition sections being most common.

The co-occurrence analysis of management domains within individual clauses reveals the complexities of legal language, for example, aquaculture regulations that simultaneously address pollution, demonstrating that regulatory provisions often span multiple threat categories. This insight is important to help understand cumulative impacts and developing comprehensive mitigation strategies.

Sources of uncertainty in the framework include researcher subjectivity in legislation inclusion and keyword list development, though the use of documented keyword lists allows for transparency and repeatability. The framework does not verify implementation or enforcement of statutes by responsible officials, presenting legislation as written rather than as practiced. Additionally, context and meaning of keywords can cause mis-categorization, requiring iterative revision to ensure accuracy. The study also notes that the number of statutes, sections, or clauses is not a measure of the quality or effectiveness of legislation, but rather provides visibility into what exists in the regulatory landscape.","Remaining knowledge gaps include the need to incorporate Indigenous legislation, Yukon Territorial legislation, municipal bylaws, and international conventions that were outside the scope of this initial study but are pivotal in Pacific salmon stewardship. Further development should address how policies, departmental frameworks, and actual implementation practices align with legislative requirements, as gaps between written legislation and enforcement can significantly affect stewardship outcomes. The framework would benefit from ongoing maintenance to account for legislative changes and updates to IUCN-CMP threat classifications, as well as, user feedback to refine keyword matching algorithms and reduce mis-categorization.

The project findings could be operationalized for Pacific salmon stewardship through several pathways. The LAPSE tool is publicly accessible to practitioners. The framework can support systematic reviews of regulatory strengths and shortcomings with respect to specific salmon threats, informing policy reforms to address gaps and improve coordination across jurisdictions. Integration with existing processes such as Recovery Potential Assessments, rebuilding plans under the Fisheries Act's Fish Stock Provisions, and Wild Salmon Policy implementation could strengthen evidence-based decision-making. Most critically, the framework should facilitate dialogue between federal and provincial authorities to address the structural disconnect between fisheries management and habitat protection, supporting the development of truly integrated, coordinated recovery strategies that span the entire salmon life cycle. The tool's open-source nature enables adaptation and refinement by the broader community of salmon stewardship practitioners, fostering collaborative improvement of the legislative interface for Pacific salmon stewardship.","Figure 1.
