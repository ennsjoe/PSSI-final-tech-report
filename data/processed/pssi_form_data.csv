Regular moni oring of harmful algal bio oxins in B.C. coas al wa ers since 2020 (Ross e al., 2025b) has revealed significan correla ions be ween clima e variables (e.g. wa er empera ure) and he concen ra ions of hese oxins in areas known o be frequen ed by Pacific salmon. These include a -risk WCVI Chinook salmon popula ions, for which harmful algae were iden ified as an emerging hrea during he WCVI Chinook Rebuilding Plan Marine Risk Assessmen (MRA) Workshop #3 held in April 2022. However, he levels of harmful algal bio oxins o which juvenile WCVI Chinook salmon are exposed in cri ical habi a s such as Barkley and Clayoquo Sounds are unknown. This is an impor an knowledge gap, given ha low early marine survival is con ribu ing o declines in WCVI Chinook and o her Pacific salmon popula ions. 

The goal of his PSSI ‘Follow he Fish’ projec was o build upon our Bio oxin Moni oring Program (Ross and Mueller, 2024) by adap ing es ablished analy ical me hods and procedures o measure harmful algal bio oxins in juvenile WCVI Chinook salmon issues (gill, liver) and habi a (Barkley Sound) using samples collec ed by ‘Follow he Fish’ krill and salmon survey eams, in par nership wi h local Firs Na ions.

These were combined o ob ain mon hly values of o al bio oxin concen ra ion a each loca ion (Fig. 2). To assess exposure o harmful algal bio oxins, juvenile WCVI Chinook salmon cap ured by purse seining close o krill survey loca ions were dissec ed o ob ain gill and liver issue samples, which were pooled as necessary o ob ain sufficien ma erial for analysis.

We found evidence of high sockeye salmon mor ali y ra es; however, he majori y of mor ali y was associa ed wi h salmon sharks, no SSL. The SSL preda ion ha did occur was concen ra ed in Queen Charlo e S rai , no he larges rookery a Triangle Island. While SSL die resul s are pending, SSL agging da a demons ra ed evidence of res ric ed foraging during he ini ial por ion of sockeye salmon migra ion (as animals are ied o breeding/pupping rookery) followed by rapid dispersal (par icularly by males) away from Triangle Island and diverse foraging s ra egies among individuals. Widespread overlap of he SSL s ock wi h migra ing Fraser River sockeye salmon appears o be less han presumed.

Collec ively, hese resul s sugges sockeye salmon may be vulnerable o a broader range of preda ors han previously considered, and ha preda or communi ies, and preda ion risk, vary hrough space and ime. Thus, previous es ima es of SSL consump ion ra es may be biased high.","Fraser River sockeye salmon produc ivi y has been poor since he early 1990s (Pe erman and Dorner 2012). Al hough he mechanism remains unclear and is likely mul iface ed (Cohen 2012), bo om-up processes ha reduce juvenile marine survival have been iden ified as a likely fac or (McKinnell e al. 2014, Freshwa er e al. 2018, Rechisky e al. 2019). More recen ly, eleva ed preda ion of re urning adul Fraser River sockeye salmon by S eller sea lions (SSL) has been hypo hesized o be a key fac or (Wal ers e al. 2020). The primary pieces of evidence used o infer SSL impac s are a) large increases in SSL popula ion size coinciden wi h Fraser River sockeye salmon declines, b) he loca ion of large SSL breeding colonies proxima e o sockeye migra ion corridors (e.g., Triangle Island rookery a he nor hwes ip of Vancouver Island is he larges in nor heas Pacific), and c) bioenerge ic modeling ha es ima ed significan removals (>1 million individuals) by SSLs if sockeye are 40% of he die during four weeks in summer and all SSLs a Bri ish Columbia rookeries arge sockeye during his period (Wal ers e al. 2020). Ye because here are no published es ima es of SSL die nor foraging dis ribu ion from rookeries and haul ou s adjacen o sockeye salmon migra ion corridors, our curren unders anding of SSL foraging ecology is insufficien o valida e key model assump ions. Fur hermore, previous empirical es ima es of sockeye salmon survival during heir marine migra ions do no have sufficien resolu ion o evalua e SSL impac s (Crossin e al. 2007, 2009). As a resul , he impac of SSL, and o her marine preda ors, on Fraser River sockeye salmon remains uncer ain.","We used mul iple me hods o evalua e SSL foraging ecology, quan ify sockeye salmon mor ali y ra es, and ul ima ely draw inference on he likely impac of SSLs on migra ing Fraser River sockeye salmon. The following ac ivi ies occurred during he 2024 and 2025 field seasons (Figure 1). 

Sockeye Salmon Me hods

Sockeye salmon were cap ured aboard a char er purse seine vessel from si es near Rennell Sound (wes coas Haida Gwaii; 2024 and 2025) and Queen Charlo e S rai (2025 only). Sockeye salmon were landed and ransferred o a flow hrough seawa er rough where biological da a, including gene ic s ock iden ifica ion (GSI) samples, were collec ed. Individuals in good physical condi ion were agged wi h ei her an acous ic or sa elli e ag before being immedia ely released. We deployed acous ic ransmi ers on sockeye salmon (n=625) which allowed individuals o be de ec ed on moored receiver arrays near Haida Gwaii, Triangle Island, Queen Charlo e S rai , hroughou he Salish Sea, and he lower Fraser River. The acous ic receiver ne work included approxima ely 40 receivers deployed by DFO hroughou coas al Bri ish Columbia, as well as infras ruc ure main ained by NOAA, he Ocean Tracking Ne work, Kin ama, and he Universi y of Bri ish Columbia. De ec ions da a will be used o parame erize mark-recap ure models o es ima e survival ra es along he migra ion corridor and iden ify ho spo s of mor ali y. We also deployed popup archival sa elli e ags (PSATs) on a smaller number of sockeye salmon (n=35). Af er releasing from he animal hese ags ransmi ligh , empera ure, and pressure sensor da a ha can be used o iden ify preda or axa (Sei z e al. 2019). 

Sockeye Salmon Findings

GSI resul s are curren ly only available for he 2024 field season; however, he majori y (>98%) of agged sockeye salmon were iden ified as belonging o Fraser River popula ions wi h Chilko Lake being he dominan conserva ion uni (~55% of all samples). Only a subse of de ec ions da a are curren ly available for 2025; however preliminary resul s in bo h years (Figure 2) indica e overall survival from Haida Gwaii o he Fraser River was poor (<8%). ~50% of individuals agged a nor hern si es were de ec ed on Haida Gwaii arrays; however, mark-recap ure models ha accoun for imperfec de ec ion probabili y on hese arrays are required for robus es ima es of survival. Survival o he Fraser River of ags deployed in Queen Charlo e S rai was markedly higher (~40%). 2% of ags were de ec ed in he s udy area af er deploymen s were comple ed, sugges ing shor - erm mor ali y due o agging or handling was minimal. Only wo ags were de ec ed a Triangle Island (bo h in 2025), however 46 ags were de ec ed in 2025 a sea lion haul ou s hroughou Queen Charlo e S rai . Impor an ly, addi ional analysis is required o de ermine how many of hese fish were likely consumed by pinnipeds based on subsequen de ec ions. No fish were repor ed as in ercep ed by fisheries in 2024, bu 5% of agged fish were recap ured by marine and in-river fisheries an","Al hough analyses are underway, here are several key preliminary resul s. We found ha sockeye salmon mor ali y ra es during adul marine migra ions may be considerably higher han previously assumed (e.g. Cohen 2012). A he same ime, i is clear ha he preda or communi y varies along he migra ory corridor—while we found some evidence of pinniped preda ion in Queen Charlo e S rai ha warran s addi ional inves iga ion, we found no evidence of pinniped preda ion near Haida Gwaii where mor ali y ra es were high and apparen ly driven by shark preda ion. Similarly, we found evidence ha preda ion impac s likely vary among and wi hin sea lion haul ou s. Despi e he large size of he Triangle Island rookery, we found a very small number of ags a his loca ion, par icularly rela ive o Queen Charlo e S rai haul ou s. 

S eller sea lion sa elli e ag pa hs highligh impor an nuances in foraging behaviour during he mon hs when Fraser River sockeye salmon are available. A his ime of year, ma ure SSL are ied o pupping, nursing and breeding wi h only in ermi en foraging. Peak pupping ypically occurs early July. Females s ay wi h heir pups fas ing for 1-2 weeks af er which hey make shor foraging rips. Females appeared o disperse from Triangle by mid-Augus o o her haul ou s around Queen Charlo e Sound and WCVI. Males had very limi ed movemen s during he breeding period. Rapid and direc ed dispersal immedia ely pos breeding (mid-July) was observed. Despi e he large number of animals concen ra ed on Triangle Island during he breeding period (coinciden wi h sockeye salmon migra ion), adjacen wa ers do no appear o be a major feeding ground his ime of year. These foraging and dispersal pa erns generally run coun er o blanke assump ions for SSL impac s on sockeye and will have implica ions for foraging models. Ongoing die analyses will provide addi ional informa ion on individual, spa ial, and seasonal variabili y in S eller sea lion foraging. 

Our resul s emphasize he impac s of a leas hree preda or axa (salmon sharks, blue sharks, S eller sea lions) on sockeye salmon warran addi ional considera ion. Given a po en ial la i udinal gradien in shark abundance (Williams e al. 2010, Proudfoo e al. 2024), popula ion level impac s may be sensi ive o where Fraser River sockeye salmon in ercep he con inen al shelf during heir re urn migra ions. All else being equal, fish making landfall near Haida Gwaii will migra e hrough a longer gaun le of preda ors han hose making landfall in Queen Charlo e Sound, which may in urn be a grea er risk han hose migra ing hrough Juan de Fuca S rai . The loca ion of landfall is uncer ain, bu if i is correla ed wi h diversion ra e, as seems likely, will vary among s ocks as well as among years (Gran e al. 2017). If we find evidence of year-specific differences in survival ra e, consis en wi h expec ed densi y dependen effec s on preda or foraging behaviour, his will add subs an ial addi ional variabili y due o sockeye salmon cyclici y. In shor , a fixed, av","Our findings highligh successful ecosys em-based managemen of sockeye salmon requires careful considera ion of fac ors ha are of en overlooked when quan ifying preda or impac s. Firs , s udies on preda ion impac s have focused on ce aceans and pinnipeds (Chasco e al. 2017a & b, Wal ers e al. 2020, Nelson e al. 2024), which have robus ime series of abundance. However, he effec of pinniped impac s will be biased high if he abundance of mul iple preda or axa have increased in synchrony. In his scenario, reducing ce acean or pinniped effec s may simply resul in he remaining preda or axa increasing in abundance. Second, bioenerge ics models are commonly used o quan ify he popula ion level impac of preda ors (Chasco e al. 2017a & b, Wal ers e al. 2020); however, hese me hods are sensi ive o assump ions abou he rela ive con ribu ion of differen species and size classes o he die (Nelson e al. 2021). These uncer ain ies are fur her amplified by seasonal and spa ial variabili y in preda or die s, as well as differences among individuals in foraging behaviour. Finally, he o al impac on prey species is also sensi ive o he propor ion of he prey popula ion ha is vulnerable o preda ion. Our findings sugges ha each of hese componen s is highly relevan when evalua ing S eller sea lion impac s on Fraser River sockeye salmon. 

In par icular, we sugges ongoing and fu ure work should address he following major dimensions. Seasonal and spa ial variabili y in S eller sea lion die s should be quan ified— his work will proceed using collec ed biochemical racers. Seasonal, sex-specific variabili y in S eller sea lion dis ribu ions should be used o es ima e he rela ive propor ion of he popula ion ha is likely o overlap spa ially and emporally wi h migra ing sockeye salmon— his work could proceed using exis ing sa elli e and overfligh survey da a.
