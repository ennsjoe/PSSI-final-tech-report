PSSI Science Project Reporting_Bianucci.docx,1/28/2026,2404,"Improving baseline knowledge of environmental conditions in Vancouver Islands fjords through observations and modelling, with a focus on hypoxia dynamics, climate change, and the potential implications for Pacific salmon",Laura Bianucci,"Ahousaht First Nation, Hesquiaht First Nation, Tla-o-qui-aht First Nation, Nuu-cha-nulth Tribal Council, Nature Trust of BC, Maaqutusiis Hahoulthee Stewardship Society","Clayoquot sound, WCVI",,Clayoquot Sound,,WCVI,,,,"Salmon spend a crucial part of their early and late life stages in fjords and are therefore affected by the nearshore environment. This project aims to understand ocean conditions in these coastal areas and how they may change under future climates, using both numerical models and observational datasets. The project focuses on Clayoquot Sound, BC, but the methods are applicable for other regions in the west coast of Vancouver Island (WCVI).

Clayoquot Sound is comprised of several fjords located in close proximity of each other. Through this project, we were able to identify how and why conditions in these fjords differ. For instance, Tofino Inlet to the south has stronger freshwater inputs, is shallower and has a weaker connection with the shelf waters than northern fjords like Sydney and Shelter Inlets, leading to a fresher and warmer Tofino Inlet compared to Sydney and Shelter. Furthermore, the role of the sills (particularly the shallow one outside of Herbert Inlet) plays a leading role modulating the deeper waters of the inlets (due to strong tidal mixing at the sill and strong tidal advection).

Monitoring of oxygen concentrations in Clayoquot Sound showed that oxygen conditions can reach levels that are stressful for Pacific salmon in all seasons and even close to the surface.

Future scenarios suggest that all of Clayoquot Sound will become warmer, while salinity will not change significantly. Fjords that are generally warmer in present-day simulations, like Tofino, are more at risk of exceeding temperature thresholds that can stress Pacific salmon.","Salmon spend time in fjords and inlets once they leave their rivers and before they venture into the open ocean. The conditions they encounter in these nearshore environments may be crucial for their success at later life stages. But, what are these conditions like and how may they change with climate? This project aims at answering those questions, with a focus on Clayoquot Sound and making use of both numerical models and observations. 

We established a monitoring program in this region, in collaboration with local indigenous groups (Ahousaht First Nation, Hesquiaht First Nation, Tla-o-qui-aht First Nation, Uu-a-thluk Fisheries, Nuu-cha-nulth Tribal Council, and Maaqutusiis Hahoulthee Stewardship Society). We supported them with funds, training, and/or materials to sample vertical profiles of temperature, salinity, and oxygen every month in their territorial waters. This project also helped maintain our existing weather station network (mostly installed in finfish farms) and supported the deployment of two moorings inside the inlets to obtain timeseries of currents, temperature, salinity and oxygen. All of these data have supported the development and evaluation of the WCVI model, which can represent observed conditions in the near past (referred to as “present-day”) and represent expected conditions under a future scenario.","Our observational methods are traditionally used in oceanographic research, e.g. sampling temperature, salinity and oxygen profiles with a CTD instrument as well as deploying moorings and weather stations. However, the innovative aspect is the collaboration with local communities. These collaborations allowed for sampling at a much higher frequency (~monthly) than anything achievable by DFO alone, but still maintaining DFO’s high-quality data standards (thanks to training and data post-processing and quality control by DFO). As a reference, DFO-led sampling provided 82 CTD profiles in 2019 (mostly from March and October/November) and 122 profiles in 2024 (a well-sampled year through many PSSI projects), while this project’s Nation-led sampling in 2024 provided 150 profiles (mostly monthly from March to December). Beyond the scientific benefits, these collaborations were essential for building long-term relationships with First Nations partners, fostering mutual trust, and creating a framework for ongoing knowledge exchange between Indigenous knowledge systems and western scientific approaches.

In terms of modelling, the WCVI model has been developed and run for 2019, 2024 (to take advantage of the intensive PSSI-related sampling) and one future scenario centered in 2055. Simulations for 2019 and 2024 have been compared against observations and show good agreement, particularly temperature and salinity. Biogeochemical variables (e.g., oxygen, nitrate) show good performance on the shelf, but some further calibration is needed to reach the desired performance inside the inlets. Figure 1 shows the model domain and bathymetry.

Analyses of model outputs in Clayoquot Sound indicate that the inlets towards the south are warmer  and fresher than those on the north at all levels of the water column and all three seasons analyzed (spring, summer, autumn). These conditions are due to stronger freshwater inputs, shallower bathymetry and a less direct connection with the shelf waters in southern inlets (Tofino to Bedwell) compared with northern inlets (Herbert to Sydney). In particular, model results allowed to study the role of the sills (particularly the shallow one outside of Herbert Inlet), which play a leading role modulating the deeper waters of the inlets (due to strong mixing at the sill and strong tidal advection).

When comparing model results against temperature values that result in stress responses by Chinook salmon (above 16 to 18°C, personal communication by PSSI colleague Christoph Deeg), we find that the surface waters of all inlets may exceed these thresholds in summer under present-day conditions (Figure 2a). Furthermore, Tofino Inlet shows waters above these thresholds at all depths (Figure 3). When analyzing the same thresholds under the future scenario, they are exceeded mostly everywhere in the Sound in the top 5 meters (Figure 2b,c), and exceeded at depth in the southern inlets (from Bedwell to Tofino). 

Once the performance of the biogeochemical module of the WCVI is deemed appropriate, a similar analysis will be performed with oxygen, considering that salmon show signs of stress at environmental values lower than 6 to 8 mg L-1 (Christoph Deeg, personal communication). Nevertheless, from the observational record we find that Clayoquot Sound shows throughout the year oxygen concentrations that fall below these thresholds, even near the surface from spring to autumn (Figure 4). 

Two peer-reviewed publications are being prepared to discuss these results, while two manuscripts are already published discussing the low near-surface oxygen conditions (Rosen et al, 2022) and describing the model (Foreman et al, 2024). Informal presentations and updates were provided regularly to Gemma Macfarlane, the Stewardship Biologist from Maaqutusiis Hahoulthee Stewardship Society from Ahousaht Nation, as well as to project collaborators. A formal presentation was provided at the last Pacific Salmon Science Symposium in December 2025 and two other ones are scheduled in January and March 2026 to the Maa-nuult Joint Fisheries Committee (JFC) Technical Meeting Series and the State of the Pacific Ocean meeting, respectively. A presentation at a scientific meeting was planned for February 2026, but travel was not approved.","This project has added key oceanographic information related to known salmon stressors (temperature, oxygen) to help understand the environment encountered by salmon while migrating towards/from the open ocean. Furthermore, future scenarios provide a management framework to assess how these environments may change over time, allowing for decisions, policy and/or plans to access useful information in case they need to adapt to future conditions. Most importantly, this project created at tool that can be further applied, e.g. by looking into other inlets or sounds as well as by expanding the model or its analysis to include other variables.   

In summary, this work has shown that the thermal tolerance of salmon can be exceeded in the southern inlets of Clayoquot Sound (particularly Tofino Inlet and especially in summer). Furthermore, the future scenario we analyzed (based on a “business as usual” scenario centered in 2055) shows an increase in the volume of waters that exceed the thermal threshold throughout Clayoquot Sound. While a less crucial stressor, we studied salinity and its potential future changes, since salmon-affecting bacteria may increase at higher salinities. We are still working on the model improvements needed to extend the analysis to oxygen conditions, which are also vital for salmon health, but observational analysis indicates that concentrations below the optimal range for salmon are ubiquitous in Clayoquot Sound.","The first next step would be to extend current analyses to other Sounds of WCVI, beyond Clayoquot Sound. But it is noteworthy that while this project has focused on temperature and oxygen, the model provides a larger set of environmental variables. Future studies could expand and deepen the analysis of existing model results, investigating the potential role of changes in other ecosystem variables currently modelled (e.g., phytoplankton, zooplankton, nutrients, etc.). Furthermore, future projects could extend the model capabilities by including the carbonate system and/or submerged aquatic vegetation modules. The former would allow for the study of ocean acidification as an environmental stressor and the latter could inform the understanding of climate change in habitat quality. Both modules are available within the modelling framework, but not yet applied to the WCVI model.

Since warming temperatures and declining oxygen concentrations will be issues affecting nearshore environments utilized by Pacific salmon, it would be crucial for salmon conservation and management to consider, mitigate, and adapt to these factors as climate changes.","Figure 1.

These estimates will be combined with climate projections to estimate how future conditions may impact salmon populations in future decades. 

Key initial findings, based on the 13 populations model: 

Environmental drivers and life stages influencing future impacts vary among populations.

All assessed populations are sensitive to projected changes

Negative impacts are expected to be greatest in southern regions (Columbia, Fraser, WCVI) and driven by increased marine temperatures and freshwater temperatures during adult migrations, while some northern populations may initially benefit from warming.

These projections will help identify the life stages most vulnerable to climate change and guide management strategies by highlighting population-specific sensitivities.","Many sockeye salmon populations have declined in abundance despite reductions in harvest, suggesting reduced productivity driven by environmental forcing, with poor marine survival identified as a key contributing factor (Peterman and Dorner 2012, Connors et al. 2020). Yet some sockeye salmon populations are stable or increasing (Brown et al. in press, Ogden et al. 2024). The cause of divergent trends in abundance is unclear, resulting in considerable uncertainty about which sockeye salmon populations are most likely to be resilient to changing environmental conditions. 

Evaluating future risk requires information on both population-specific stressors and biological responses to those stressors. Although quantitative climate change vulnerability assessments have been performed for a number of Pacific salmon populations, they have largely focused on American Chinook salmon populations from a small number of watersheds (e.g. Crozier et al. 2021). Here we leveraged a unique dataset of juvenile and adult abundance from a network of thirteen sockeye salmon populations extending from the Columbia River to northern British Columbia. We parameterized an age-structured life cycle model that included freshwater and marine covariates to estimate population-specific functional responses, then evaluated how populations fared under various climate change scenarios. Our study incorporated expertise from diverse collaborators, within and outside DFO, with expertise in stock assessment, global climate models, and salmon ecology. Our work can be used to identify Pacific salmon life stages that are most vulnerable to climate change and help prioritize management interventions.","Overview of the model
We developed a full life cycle model that consists of two stages: 1) spawner to smolt production and 2) smolt to adult recruit survival (Figure 1). Each stage of the model consists of a Beverton-Holt function, where density-independent production (i.e., survival) is a function of the environmental conditions experienced in that life stage. We modelled each age class separately because sockeye salmon vary in the number of years that they spend rearing in freshwater as well as in the ocean, and covariates were lagged so that each age class was only affected when it overlapped in space and time with a given covariate. 

We used a state space approach that linked population dynamics to the observed data and accounted for cyclical feedback among generations. This structure allowed us to account for missing data, observation error, and variation in the life stage that was observed for juveniles (smolt vs. fry). The model was implemented in Stan and fit using Bayesian inference within a hierarchical framework, allowing information to be shared across populations. 

Salmon data

Our model is based on thirteen populations of sockeye salmon (Figure 2) where there are estimates of spawner abundance, juvenile abundance (smolt or fry), and adult recruitment. In addition, we have estimates of age structure for juveniles, adult recruits, or both. These populations come from six different watersheds spanning the entire province of BC: Columbia, Somass, Fraser, Skeena, Stikine, Taku. We included data from 1981 to 2024 in our model.

Environmental covariates

We selected environmental covariates based on our understanding of the sockeye salmon lifecycle and when and where the populations experience different conditions. To do this, we developed a directed acyclic graph (DAG; simplified version in Figure 2) that outlines our hypothesized causal effects, as well as our understanding of how environmental covariates influence each other or are influenced by shared drivers (e.g., a common regional climate). We were unable to include all hypothesized covariates, because in many cases we do not have appropriate data for all populations. For example, we know that zooplankton community composition is likely to influence survival (Peterson and Schwing 2003) and that zooplankton dynamics are in turn influenced by temperature and mixed layer depth (Mackas et al. 2012). Thus, based on our model structure, we can interpret any effects of marine temperature and mixed layer depth as being, at least partially due to their effects on zooplankton. In this way, we use the DAG to understand whether our estimated environmental effects are likely to be biased or confounded, and to adjust our model and interpretation accordingly. 

The environmental covariates (Figure 3) that we hypothesized could influence spawner to smolt production were: 1) winter (Oct. to Mar.) rearing temperatures (2 or 3 years after spawning), and summer (Apr. to Sep.) rearing temperatures (1 or 2 years after spawning) in nursery lakes. The environmental covariates that may influence smolt to adult recruit survival were: 1) near surface temperature averaged across the juvenile marine migration route for the period of April to June; 2) mixed layer depth averaged across the juvenile marine migration route for the period of April to June; 3) near surface temperatures in the open ocean in summer (Jul. to Sep., 1 or 2 years after ocean entry) and winter (Jan. - Mar.; 1,2, or 3 years after ocean entry); 4) river temperature during upstream migration , 5) river discharge during upstream migration. 

Freshwater temperatures and discharge were sourced from the Pacific Climate Impact Consortium (Werner et al. 2019). The juvenile marine migration route is defined as all polygons in Figure 2 from the point of ocean entry for each population and north to Alaska along the continental shelf (i.e., depths less than 500 m). The open-ocean domain was defined by a rectangular polygon in the North Pacific, bounded by 170°W, 145°W, 60°N, and 45°N; areas shallower than 1000 m and regions north of the Aleutian Islands were excluded. Coastal temperature and mixed layer depth were sourced from the BCCM downscaled climate model (Peña and Fine 2024), the HOTSsea model (Oldford et al. 2024) and the GLORYS12 reanalysis (E.U. Copernicus Marine Service Information (CMEMS). Marine Data Store (MDS)). Open ocean temperatures were sourced from GLORYS12. 

Future projections

We are still in the process of integrating our model with future climate projections. 

This will be done by taking the estimated parameters of our model and applying them to averaged historical (1995 to 2025) baseline conditions as well as future projected (2041 to 2070) environmental conditions. This will allow us to estimate how the mean number of adult recruits per spawner is expected to change between these two periods, due to climate change. We plan to contrast the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 future climate scenarios to assess how sensitive our projections are to the specific emission scenario. Future climate projections will be sourced from the BCCM (Pena et al.) model, downscaled CMIP6 model (ACTEA) and PCIC (citation). 

Initial results

We find that all populations are sensitive to environmental change at some point in the lifecycle (Figure 4). However, there is considerable variation across populations as to where in the lifecycle environmental conditions have the greatest impact. Southern populations (WCVI and Columbia) appear to be most sensitive to changes in the early marine stage. Fraser and Columbia populations appear to be most sensitive to warm waters experienced during upstream migration. In contrast, summer temperatures during lake residence had a relatively small effect on recruitment for all populations. Northern populations show greater variability in their responses, and some may even benefit from some degree of warming.","Although we are still integrating our population model with future climate projections, our preliminary results highlight striking similarities and differences among sockeye salmon populations that are relevant to management. The majority of populations showed marked declines in abundance as marine and freshwater temperatures increase. Yet the life stages and environmental drivers regulating future impacts varied among populations.  These patterns suggest management interventions will be most effective if they are applied in a regional or population-specific context and target life stages that have the greatest impact on subsequent recruitment. 

More broadly, our findings emphasize the value of leveraging life cycle models when evaluating climate change risk. Climate change vulnerability assessments often rely on predicted changes in putative stressors, rather than population level responses to those stressors. Such frameworks implicitly assume that populations respond similarly to, for example, one degree of warming. Furthermore, without clear linkages to a biological response, it is often challenging to evaluate the relative impact of stressors in different spatial domains (e.g., freshwater vs. marine temperatures) or representing different physical processes (e.g., changes in temperature vs. flow). Although qualitative approaches are necessary in data limited scenarios, uncertainties should be clearly communicated to decision makers.

Despite its complexity, our model only incorporated abundance data from three life stages, limiting our ability to precisely link indicators to biological responses. Marine spatiotemporal distributions are also relatively poorly resolved, particularly for more data-limited northern populations and for all populations during offshore residence. Both of these factors will increase the uncertainty associated with effect size estimates. Additionally, we could only incorporate indicators that were readily available in historical time series and climate projections, and we assumed that ecological responses to environmental drivers would remain constant in the future. Such assumptions are necessary in correlative models where the mechanisms linking, for example, temperature to survival remain unknown, but may lead to biased estimates of life stage-specific effects. Given the complexity of ecological systems (e.g., non-stationarity; Litzow et al. 2019), our predictions should be viewed cautiously and revised as additional data become available.","The goal of the project is to estimate how climate related environmental variables are influencing sockeye salmon productivity across different life stages and populations using quantitative models. These estimates will be combined with climate projections to estimate how future conditions may impact salmon populations in future decades.

PSSI Science Project Reporting Template Johannessen.docx,1/28/2026,2406,"Changing coastal productivity: using sediment cores, water properties and archived plankton data to identify changes at the bottom of the food web in BC’s coastal waters",Sophia Johannessen,,BC Mainland Inlets,,BC Inlets and Salish Sea,,BC coastal waters,,,,"The main idea of the project was to determine whether the bottom of the salmon food web (amount and type of phytoplankton production) had changed in recent decades as a result of climate change, using sediment core records combined with water properties data. 

Results differ among inlets. The sediment core trends indicate a change toward a longer, less nutritious food web in some inlets but not others. Further work will explore the data more deeply to provide a robust interpretation in the context of climate-linked changes in freshwater inflow, productivity and seawater circulation.

The final results of this project will be available to inform the new, ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management on the BC coast.","Until recently, fisheries models ascribed the decline in Salish Sea salmon populations to a 30% decrease in total primary productivity since the 1970s. Geochemical data (Johannessen et al., 2021, CJFAS) have since shown that total productivity has been constant for the last century in the Salish Sea. However, a change in the type of productivity could have affected salmon, by changing the nutritional value of available food. In addition, it is not known whether total productivity has changed outside the Salish Sea. A change from diatom- to dinoflagellate-dominance is thought to have occurred in nearby Puget Sound, due to a change in the ratios of dissolved nutrients and in the timing of freshwater discharge. 

This project relates to drivers of salmon decline. Once complete, the results will be available to inform ecosystem models used to set fisheries catch limits. In the context of the new requirement for ecosystem variability to be included in salmon stock assessment, it will be crucial for fisheries managers to understand changes in the food web and in the physical and chemical properties of coastal seawater.

In addition to interpreting trends in primary productivity, based on sediment cores, the PI will collaborate with a biological oceanographer (Akash Sastri, DFO) and an American chemical oceanographer with data from Puget Sound (Christopher Krembs, Washington State Dept. of Ecology). The collaborations will permit a comparison with a time series of plankton taxonomic data and put the results from BC inlets into a wider regional context. The results will be published in scientific papers and in a proposed CSAS Science Response.","This project mainly used sediment cores, with water samples and electronic (CTD) data profiles to support the interpretation of environmental conditions.","Results to date indicate that each inlet tells its own story. Knight Inlet, for example, has about twenty times the terrigenous carbon flux of Roscoe Inlet (Figure 2). However, the marine bloom flux (related to high productivity and a short (nutritious) food chain) is only five times as high in Knight as in Roscoe, and the non-bloom flux is similar in the two inlets. This indicates that the ratio of highly nutritious to less nutritious food at the base of the salmon food web is likely higher in Knight than Roscoe Inlet. In addition, the trends over time are different in the two inlets (Figure 2). It is possible that fisheries management in inlets will require inlet-specific consideration of environmental variables.  Once the sediment core interpretation is complete and is put into the environmental context of each inlet, this information will be available to inform the ecosystem models that support salmon stock assessment.","The next steps are:

Complete the interpretation of the sediment core data: calculate trends in marine and terrigenous carbon flux in the remaining cores.

Calculate nutrient ratios from water samples for all inlets for spring and autumn/winter, and compare these to the ratios and trends over time in the Salish Sea.

Determine whether differences in marine fluxes among inlets are related to surface nutrients and/or freshwater discharge.

Work with colleagues in biological oceanography and fisheries to convert this information into an indicator that could be incorporated into the ecological models that inform fisheries stock assessment.

From 2023-2024, Chinook originating from Stamp River, Sarita River and Nitinat River were caught during their marine outmigration using seining and dip netting methods. In the Stamp River and Somass estuary, juvenile Chinook originating from Stamp River were caught through dip net and beach seine surveys with Hupacasath First Nation. In the Sarita Estuary, beach and purse seine surveys were led by Huu-ay-aht First Nation and LGL Limited and data and samples were shared with this project. In Nitinat Lake, beach seine surveys were carried out with Ditidaht First Nation to catch juveniles from the Nitinat River population. Juvenile Chinook from these populations were then caught during their first marine summer in Barkley Sound via purse seine surveys from 2022-2025 in collaboration with Huu-ay-aht First Nation and LGL Limited. Finally, juvenile salmon were followed through their first winter at sea with microtrolling surveys carried out in nearshore marine waters in Sooke Basin through Quatsino Sound on the WCVI.

Over 14,700 fin-clip samples were submitted to determine stock of origin using Genetic Stock Identification (GSI) and Parentage-based Tagging (PBT) methods. Over 5,100 juvenile Chinook of WCVI origin were lethally retained to obtain internal tissues for investigating fish health and condition.

We found evidence of high sockeye salmon mortality rates; however, the majority of mortality was associated with salmon sharks, not SSL. The SSL predation that did occur was concentrated in Queen Charlotte Strait, not the largest rookery at Triangle Island. While SSL diet results are pending, SSL tagging data demonstrated evidence of restricted foraging during the initial portion of sockeye salmon migration (as animals are tied to breeding/pupping rookery) followed by rapid dispersal (particularly by males) away from Triangle Island and diverse foraging strategies among individuals. Widespread overlap of the SSL stock with migrating Fraser River sockeye salmon appears to be less than presumed.

Collectively, these results suggest sockeye salmon may be vulnerable to a broader range of predators than previously considered, and that predator communities, and predation risk, vary through space and time. Thus, previous estimates of SSL consumption rates may be biased high.","Fraser River sockeye salmon productivity has been poor since the early 1990s (Peterman and Dorner 2012). Although the mechanism remains unclear and is likely multifaceted (Cohen 2012), bottom-up processes that reduce juvenile marine survival have been identified as a","We used multiple methods to evaluate SSL foraging ecology, quantify sockeye salmon mortality rates, and ultimately draw inference on the likely impact of SSLs on migrating Fraser River sockeye salmon. The following activities occurred during the 2024 and 2025 field seasons (Figure 1). 

Sockeye Salmon Methods

Sockeye salmon were captured aboard a charter purse seine vessel from sites near Rennell Sound (west coast Haida Gwaii; 2024 and 2025) and Queen Charlotte Strait (2025 only). Sockeye salmon were landed and transferred to a flow through seawater trough where biological data, including genetic stock identification (GSI) samples, were collected. Individuals in good physical condition were tagged with either an acoustic or satellite tag before being immediately released. We deployed acoustic transmitters on sockeye salmon (n=625) which allowed individuals to be detected on moored receiver arrays near Haida Gwaii, Triangle Island, Queen Charlotte Strait, throughout the Salish Sea, and the lower Fraser River. The acoustic receiver network included approximately 40 receivers deployed by DFO throughout coastal British Columbia, as well as infrastructure maintained by NOAA, the Ocean Tracking Network, Kintama, and the University of British Columbia. Detections data will be used to parameterize mark-recapture models to estimate survival rates along the migration corridor and identify hotspots of mortality. We also deployed popup archival satellite tags (PSATs) on a smaller number of sockeye salmon (n=35). After releasing from the animal these tags transmit light, temperature, and pressure sensor data that can be used to identify predator taxa (Seitz et al. 2019). 

Sockeye Salmon Findings

GSI results are currently only available for the 2024 field season; however, the majority (>98%) of tagged sockeye salmon were identified as belonging to Fraser River populations with Chilko Lake being the dominant conservation unit (~55% of all samples). Only a subset of detections data are currently available for 2025; however preliminary results in both years (Figure 2) indicate overall survival from Haida Gwaii to the Fraser River was poor (<8%). ~50% of individuals tagged at northern sites were detected on Haida Gwaii arrays; however, mark-recapture models that account for imperfect detection probability on these arrays are required for robust estimates of survival. Survival to the Fraser River of tags deployed in Queen Charlotte Strait was markedly higher (~40%). 2% of tags were detected in the study area after deployments were completed, suggesting short-term mortality due to tagging or handling was minimal. Only two tags were detected at Triangle Island (both in 2025), however 46 tags were detected in 2025 at sea lion haul outs throughout Queen Charlotte Strait. Importantly, additional analysis is required to determine how many of these fish were likely consumed by pinnipeds based on subsequent detections. No fish were reported as intercepted by fisheries in 2024, but 5% of tagged fish were recaptured by marine and in-river fisheries and reported in 2025.

We deployed 18 PSATs at Haida Gwaii sites in 2024 and 17 in 2025 (ten in Haida Gwaii and seven in Queen Charlotte Strait). Six of the 2024 PSATs failed to report due to engineering issues. All of the remaining 12 reported before their programmed release data, suggesting the fish were predated. Of the confirmed mortalities, three could not be classified because the tag was not ingested, one was consumed by a benthic ectotherm, and eight were consumed by salmon sharks (Figure 3). In 2025, all PSATs reported and five survived to release, all from the Queen Charlotte Strait study area. Of the ten Haida Gwaii tags, four were consumed by blue sharks, three by a benthic ectotherm, and three by salmon sharks. Neither of the two Queen Charlotte Strait mortalities could be classified (Figure 3).

SSL Methods

We deployed satellite tags (paired head-mounted splash and flipper-mounted spot tags) on adult male (n=7) and female (n=14) SSLs on Triangle Island. Animals were sedated via darting gun and tagged with the assistance of staff from the Vancouver Aquarium. Females were captured near the end of July following pupping; males were captured at the beginning of June as animals staked out territories for the breeding period. Head mounted tags were epoxied to the fur and were shed by fall during the annual moult while the flipper mounted tags should stay affixed for multiple years although tag programming and battery life will ultimately determine transmission duration. The high resolution, yet shorter deployment splash tags will allow for an understanding of foraging behaviour (location and dive profiles) and sex-specific habitat use revealing explicit spatial-temporal overlap with sockeye salmon during their migration through Queen Charlotte Sound. This distribution data is critical in evaluating the relative proportion of the SSL population that has the opportunity to predate sockeye salmon. The longer-term flipper tags (8-16 months; multi-year) will allow for multi-season information on coarse foraging patterns. 

We also collected SSL diet information via biochemical tracers and scats from sites on Triangle Island, as well as key haul outs in Queen Charlotte Strait, southwest coast of Vancouver Island, and the southern Strait of Georgia. The two biochemical tracers we have focused on, fatty acid profiles and stable isotopes, provide estimates of diet composition integrated over weeks to month. The fatty acid analysis (FAA; Budget et al. 2006) will provide more discrete diet estimation (prey-specific proportions) while the stable isotope analysis (SIA; Layman et al. 2012) will be useful to discriminate feeding source (pelagic vs demersal, nearshore vs shelf vs shelf break) such that we can broadly characterize foraging behaviour beyond the satellite tagged individuals. Diets estimated from scats provide a short-term (~ 1 day) estimate requiring far more extensive, repeated sampling to capture temporal variation in diet-particularly if the objective is to capture a potential pulse of a relatively rapidly migrating prey. While we collected scats (n=1,200), there was insufficient funding provided to analyze these, let alone undertake a full-fledged sampling design for scats. These are therefore archived for potential future work and analysis focused on the integrated tracer samples. In total, ~400 sea lion biopsy samples were obtained directly from satellite tagged animals or randomly via a crossbow system. To estimate diet, over 1500 potential fish and invertebrate prey samples were obtained from various DFO research cruises. 

SSL Findings

During the 5 – 6-week deployments prior to moult, female foraging was concentrated on the continental shelf (Figure 4a). In the initial weeks, animals used Triangle Island as a central place for short foraging forays. As pups inevitably grew and became more independent, there was a gradual expansion and dispersal away from Triangle east to Cook Bank and Queen Charlotte Strait and south-east to Quatsino Sound with females ultimately moving to sites both east and south of Triangle Island. During the 14 – 16-week deployments prior to moult, males demonstrated very limited foraging activity during the breeding period (Figure 4b). Subsequently by mid-July there was rapid and directed dispersal immediately post-breeding with individuals ranging as far north as southeast Alaska and south to the Washington border. Triangle was not used as major haul out outside of the breeding period for either females or males. More in-depth analysis of distribution and dive behaviour is underway to explicitly parameterize sea lion foraging effort in a spatial context and provide support for interpreting diet results.  

Stable isotope and fatty acid datasets for potential prey and sea lions have been completed for 2023-2024 samples; 2025 samples are currently being processed and analyzed. Preliminary analysis of 2023-2024 SI values for known age class and sex animals suggests that males and females are exploiting different prey/habitats diverging further with age (Figure 5).","Although analyses are underway, there are several key preliminary results. We found that sockeye salmon mortality rates during adult marine migrations may be considerably higher than previously assumed (e.g. Cohen 2012). At the same time, it is clear that the predator community varies along the migratory corridor—while we found some evidence of pinniped predation in Queen Charlotte Strait that warrants additional investigation, we found no evidence of pinniped predation near Haida Gwaii where mortality rates were high and apparently driven by shark predation. Similarly, we found evidence that predation impacts likely vary among and within sea lion haul outs.  Despite the large size of the Triangle Island rookery, we found a very small number of tags at this location, particularly relative to Queen Charlotte Strait haul outs. 

Steller sea lion satellite tag paths highlight important nuances in foraging behaviour during the months when Fraser River sockeye salmon are available. At this time of year, mature SSL are tied to pupping, nursing and breeding with only intermittent foraging. Peak pupping typically occurs early July. Females stay with their pups fasting for 1-2 weeks after which they make short foraging trips. Females appeared to disperse from Triangle by mid-August to other haul outs around Queen Charlotte Sound and WCVI. Males had very limited movements during the breeding period. Rapid and directed dispersal immediately post breeding (mid-July) was observed. Despite the large number of animals concentrated on Triangle Island during the breeding period (coincident with sockeye salmon migration), adjacent waters do not appear to be a major feeding ground this time of year. These foraging and dispersal patterns generally run counter to blanket assumptions for SSL impacts on sockeye and will have implications for foraging models. Ongoing diet analyses will provide additional information on individual, spatial, and seasonal variability in Steller sea lion foraging. 

Our results emphasize the impacts of at least three predator taxa (salmon sharks, blue sharks, Steller sea lions) on sockeye salmon warrant additional consideration. Given a potential latitudinal gradient in shark abundance (Williams et al. 2010, Proudfoot et al. 2024), population level impacts may be sensitive to where Fraser River sockeye salmon intercept the continental shelf during their return migrations. All else being equal, fish making landfall near Haida Gwaii will migrate through a longer gauntlet of predators than those making landfall in Queen Charlotte Sound, which may in turn be at greater risk than those migrating through Juan de Fuca Strait. The location of landfall is uncertain, but if it is correlated with diversion rate, as seems likely, will vary among stocks as well as among years (Grant et al. 2017). If we find evidence of year-specific differences in survival rate, consistent with expected density dependent effects on predator foraging behaviour, this will add substantial additional variability due to sockeye salmon cyclicity. In short, a fixed, average predation rate applied to all stocks is likely inappropriate. Unfortunately, using statistical models to quantify the relative impact of each taxa is not possible given a lack of abundance data for blue and salmon sharks.","Our findings highlight successful ecosystem-based management of sockeye salmon requires careful consideration of factors that are often overlooked when quantifying predator impacts. First, studies on predation impacts have focused on cetaceans and pinnipeds (Chasco et al. 2017a & b, Walters et al. 2020, Nelson et al. 2024), which have robust time series of abundance. However, the effect of pinniped impacts will be biased high if the abundance of multiple predator taxa have increased in synchrony. In this scenario, reducing cetacean or pinniped effects may simply result in the remaining predator taxa increasing in abundance. Second, bioenergetics models are commonly used to quantify the population level impact of predators (Chasco et al. 2017a & b, Walters et al. 2020); however, these methods are sensitive to assumptions about the relative contribution of different species and size classes to the diet (Nelson et al. 2021). These uncertainties are further amplified by seasonal and spatial variability in predator diets, as well as differences among individuals in foraging behaviour. Finally, the total impact on prey species is also sensitive to the proportion of the prey population that is vulnerable to predation. Our findings suggest that each of these components is highly relevant when evaluating Steller sea lion impacts on Fraser River sockeye salmon. 

In particular, we suggest ongoing and future work should address the following major dimensions. Seasonal and spatial variability in Steller sea lion diets should be quantified—this work will proceed using collected biochemical tracers. Seasonal, sex-specific variability in Steller sea lion distributions should be used to estimate the relative proportion of the population that is likely to overlap spatially and temporally with migrating sockeye salmon—this work could proceed using existing satellite and overflight survey data. Steller sea lion distributions should be paired with estimates of interannual and stock-specific variability in sockeye salmon migration routes to evaluate relative risk—this work is proceeding using historical catch data, but it is currently unclear whether existing data are sufficient. Since salmon-predator interactions are highly context-dependent (Wells et al. 2025), until the above data gaps are addressed efforts to mitigate predator impacts should proceed with caution and a careful consideration of the associated uncertainties.","Figure 1.

Overall, findings suggest that OA and, to a lesser degree elevated seawater temperatures, may result in altered fatty acid composition in pteropods, potentially leading to shifts in nutritional quality and associated impacts on trophic energy transfer. Additionally, results indicate that temperature stress could pose more immediate threat to pteropod survival.

We propose that any changes in the nutritive status of L. helicina under climate stressor conditions could have carry-over impacts to juvenile salmon growth, health, and survival. However, we highlight that this study represents preliminary findings only and future research is needed to assess multi-trophic impacts.","Under global climate change, co-occurrence of gradual physical changes in seawater and extreme events pose a substantial threat to marine ecosystems (IPCC, 2023). This PSSI-funded project focused on the Strait of Georgia (SOG) within the Northeast Pacific coastal region where steady rises in mean seasonal seawater temperatures and pCO2 levels, and increasingly prevalent acute stressor events such as heatwaves and low-pH upwellings, are already occurring (Bylhouwer et al., 2013; Evans et al., 2019; Okey et al., 2024; Raymond et al., 2022; Talloni-Alvarez et al., 2014). Moreover, the SOG is distinctive as conditions of high pCO2 and aragonite undersaturation persist year-round across a wide extent of the water column (Moore-Maley et al., 2016; Simpson et al., 2024). Limacina helicina, a cold-water pteropod well-represented within the region’s zooplankton communities, is highly susceptible to climate change stressors, with documented impacts of ocean warming and ocean acidification (OA) on shell development, growth, and survival (Bednaršek et al., 2016, 2022; Lischka et al., 2022; Lischka & Riebesell, 2012). However, there has been minimal investigation of climate change effects on the species’ nutritional status (e.g. fatty acid (FA) composition) under regionally-relevant conditions. Given the importance of L. helicina as a dietary item for some populations of juvenile Pacific salmon species in the Northeast Pacific (Brodeur et al., 2007; Doubleday & Hopcroft, 2015; Sturdevant et al., 2012), it was proposed that any change in the nutritive status of L. helicina under climate stressor conditions could have carry-over impacts to juvenile salmon growth, health, and survival. 

The project involved cross-program collaboration between DFO researchers based at the Pacific Biological Station (PBS) and the Pacific Science Enterprise Centre (PSEC) for investigation of the impacts of warming and OA conditions (representative of future conditions in the SOG) on FA profiles of L. helicina populations in the region. Limacina helicina samples were collected and processed as part of juvenile Pacific salmon survey fieldwork carried out in the SOG during 2014−2023 by the Salmon Marine Interactions Program at PBS (Lead: Neville). The program also supported live collection (within the SOG) of L. helicina for a climate change experiment (2023). Subsequent field sample sorting (i.e. extraction of whole pteropods from historical size-fractionated plankton samples) and laboratory experimentation (i.e. conducting of a climate change experiment in the Fisheries and Oceans Climate Change and Ocean Acidification Laboratory (FOCCOAL)), and nutritional analyses (i.e. FA analyses via gas chromatography) were carried out by the Sustainable Invertebrate Aquaculture Program at PBS (Lead: Pearce) and Nutrition Program at PSEC (Lead: Forster), respectively.","Climate Change Experiment: 
Live L. helicina (Figure 1) were collected from the SOG in early October 2023 for use in a climate stressor experiment. Collection of approximately 800 pteropods was carried out over a 7-h period across a centrally-located area of the SOG via a series of vertical tows (N=9) using a bongo net collar assembly with two 58-cm diameter Nitex nets (253-µm mesh) deployed to a maximum depth of 300 m. Following, jars with animals were kept in a temperature-controlled cool box (~12°C, dark conditions). Within 24 h of collection, all pteropods were transported to the FOCCOAL at PBS for application to a climate change experiment. A full factorial design was applied to the experiment, resulting in four treatments: Control, OA, Warming, OA+Warming (n=6 tanks per treatment). Treatment conditions were achieved via use of the FOCCOAL, which employs a programmable logic controller and automated seawater and gas mixing systems to tightly control seawater temperature and pCO2, respectively. Pteropods were exposed to singular and coinciding warming (mean summer seawater temperature + 4°C) and OA (Ωaragonite < 1) conditions, with subsequent FA analyses carried out on 48-h and 5-d timepoint samples via gas chromatography (at PSEC). Results indicated a significant impact of OA on nutritional status at 48 h (Figure 2) and a significant impact of temperature on survival at 5 d (Figure 3). 

Time-series Analyses (Field Samples):

Additionally, FA analyses of L. helicina picked from historical plankton samples collected in the SOG as part of juvenile Pacific salmon survey work (Neville et al., 2025, 2026a, 2026b, 2026c, 2026d, 2026e; Neville & Spencer, 2026) were carried out to examine time-series changes in FA profiles in relation to regional temperature records (e.g. DFO British Columbia Shore Station Oceanographic Program, Chrome Island Lightstation temperature dataset). A subset (N=35) of frozen 1-mm size-fractioned samples covering a 10-year time series (2014–2023) were compiled to carry out pteropod FA profiling. Within a given year (N=7), five sampling stations were selected according to target tow depth and location. Sub-samples of the 1-mm size class samples from each station were used to obtain whole pteropods for FA analyses. FA analyses was carried out at PSEC via gas chromatography with results indicating significant differences in a number of fractions between year groups and in the overall FA profiles of a number of year groups (2016 and 2019; 2018 and 2021) (Figure 4), the latter findings parallelled by minor to moderate divergences in seasonal temperature conditions.",Project data may be fed into predictive habitat distribution modelling and climate change vulnerability assessments for Pacific salmon species (e.g. ACCASP’s Fish Stock Climate Vulnerability Assessment Tool (FSCVAT)). This would enable environmental/aquaculture managers and decision-makers to prepare for and respond to the impacts of climate change.,"Findings here provide preliminary evidence that L. helicina of the SOG region may tolerate persistent OA conditions with minimal impact to survival, but potentially at the expense of energy stores. Moreover, declining aragonite saturation state across the area could pose further detriment to their role as a food source to upper trophic species. In addition, we propose that temperature stress could pose more immediate threat to survival, particularly if warming in upper surface layers extends throughout the wider water column. Results highlight the need for improved understanding of ecological interactions under climate change conditions with regard to food-web dynamics, and the importance of considering multiple stressors when determining vulnerability of L. helicina to future climate change conditions. Recommendations for future studies include the development of larger experimental mesocosms for improved pteropod holding facilities and extension of experimental time lines to encompass longer-term exposure periods. The current work could also be followed-up with laboratory-based salmon feeding trials to determine whether (and to what extent) impacts to pteropods relay to juvenile salmon growth/health (e.g. multi-trophic impacts).","Figure 2.

juvenile WCVI Chinook salmon are exposed to and take up harmful algal biotoxins in Barkley Sound. 

biotoxins known to harm fish peak in summer/fall in Barkley Sound in both water and fish tissues.

results suggest that biotoxin exposure/impacts can be mitigated e.g. via timing of hatchery releases.","Biotoxins produced by harmful algae are know to cause illness and mortality in marine animals including juvenile fish (Lefebvre et al., 2005). Regular monitoring of harmful algal biotoxins in B.C. coastal waters since 2020 (Ross et al., 2025b) has revealed significant correlations between climate variables (e.g. water temperature) and the concentrations of these toxins in areas known to be frequented by Pacific salmon. These include at-risk WCVI Chinook salmon populations, for which harmful algae were identified as an emerging threat during the WCVI Chinook Rebuilding Plan Marine Risk Assessment (MRA) Workshop #3 held in April 2022. However, the levels of harmful algal biotoxins to which juvenile WCVI Chinook salmon are exposed in critical habitats such as Barkley and Clayoquot Sounds are unknown. This is an important knowledge gap, given that low early marine survival is contributing to declines in WCVI Chinook and other Pacific salmon populations. 

The goal of this PSSI ‘Follow the Fish’ project was to build upon our Biotoxin Monitoring Program (Ross and Mueller, 2024) by adapting established analytical methods and procedures to measure harmful algal biotoxins in juvenile WCVI Chinook salmon tissues (gill, liver) and habitat (Barkley Sound) using samples collected by ‘Follow the Fish’ krill and salmon survey teams, in partnership with local First Nations. This information is being combined with environmental data (water properties, eDNA), assessments of fish health and condition (biometrics, gene expression), and information on life history (otolith microchemistry) to help forecast and potentially mitigate early marine exposure of WCVI Chinook salmon to harmful algal biotoxins, and associated impacts on their health and survival.","Harmful algal biotoxins were measured in sea water using the method developed for our Marine Biotoxin Monitoring Program (Ross and Mueller, 2024). Surface sea water was collected at 5 locations in Barkley Sound (Fig. 1) during krill surveys carried out at the beginning of each month and filtered on board to obtain filter and filtrate samples, from which biotoxins were extracted and analyzed by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry to obtain dissolved and particulate biotoxin concentrations (Ross et al., 2025a). These were combined to obtain monthly values of total biotoxin concentration at each location (Fig. 2). To assess exposure to harmful algal biotoxins, juvenile WCVI Chinook salmon captured by purse seining close to krill survey locations were dissected to obtain gill and liver tissue samples, which were pooled as necessary to obtain sufficient material for analysis. 

Products and tools developed during this project include a Regional Biotoxin Database (in progress) for organizing, storing and retrieving biotoxin and related environmental, biological, and taxonomic information for sea water and biological samples collected during this project (and the Marine Biotoxin Monitoring Program) with the goal of making it available to co-workers via DMApps.  

Advances in methodology during this project include procedures to minimize cross-contamination while dissecting and pooling of tissues for biotoxin analysis, and adaptation of the method for sea water analysis to measure harmful algal biotoxins in very small amounts of tissue, thereby allowing them to be studied in individual fish, organs and/or early life stages (Mueller et al., in preparation).  

Examples of communication and knowledge transfer include a Newsletter (Ross and Loseto, 2025) that describes the monitoring of biotoxins and contaminants during the PSSI ‘Follow the Fish’ project. Results from the monitoring of biotoxins in Barkley Sound during fall 2023 were also included in a report prepared for Snuneymuxw First Nation (Ross, 2024) on the measurement of harmful algal biotoxins near Nanaimo at the same time, to provide context for the interpretation of those results. Knowledge about seasonal trends in biotoxin concentration obtained during this project, and how it can be used to mitigate risks associated with biotoxin exposure in juvenile salmon through the timing of hatchery releases, was presented during a Fish Health & Hatchery Biology Seminar (Ross, 2025). 

Key results include:

detection and identification of seasonal patterns in the concentrations of harmful algal biotoxins in Barkley Sound, including those know to be harmful to juvenile fish (Fig. 2).

detection of certain biotoxins in the tissues of juvenile WCVI Chinook salmon present in Barkley Sound when those biotoxins are relatively abundant in the surrounding water (June to September).

recognition that WCVI Chinook are being exposed to harmful algal biotoxins in their critical habitat during early marine life stages, at levels sufficient to cause uptake in gill and liver tissues (Fig. 3).","This project has revealed that juvenile WCVI Chinook salmon present in Barkley Sound during late summer are exposed to harmful algal biotoxins at levels sufficient to cause uptake in their tissues. 

biotoxins present in Barkley Sound follow seasonal trends similar to those observed elsewhere in B.C. coastal waters (Fig. 2).

juvenile WCVI Chinook salmon in Barkley Sound are exposed to increasing levels of algal biotoxins from May onwards, particularly at central and outer locations (Coaster, Swale, Mackenzie: Fig. 1).

exposure of juvenile WCVI Chinook salmon to biotoxins is confirmed by detection of domoic acid, yessotoxin, and the paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxin saxitoxin in gill and/or liver tissue from purse seined fish caught in Barkley Sound in late summer 2023 and/or 2024.

levels of biotoxins detected in tissues seem to correlate with those in the surrounding water (Fig. 3).

Results from our Marine Biotoxin Monitoring Program suggest that certain biotoxins including those harmful to juvenile fish are trending upwards in B.C. coastal waters, and that higher biotoxin levels may be associated with climate-related factors such as increasing temperature and/or nutrient limitation due to stratification caused by higher temperatures or freshwater inputs (Ross at al., 2025). 

Tools are being developed (CSRF project 2025-26-11-07) to predict future levels of biotoxin exposure and uptake based upon linkages with environmental conditions measured at the same time. This will allow DFO to forecast and potentially mitigate levels and impacts of biotoxin exposure in WCVI Chinook; for example, by timing the release of hatchery fish to minimize exposure (Ross, 2025).  

   

Meanwhile, gene expression analysis is being carried out (Art Bass et al.) to see whether observed levels of biotoxin exposure result in stress responses, biological effects and/or health impacts in juvenile salmon, thereby helping to identify biologically significant thresholds of exposure for these limiting factors.

We are working with the Contaminants group (Lisa Loseto et al.) to investigate the separate and cumulative effects of biotoxins and contaminants on juvenile WCVI Chinook salmon, taking advantage of the observed seasonal trends in biotoxin exposure.

We are also working with the Otolith Microchemistry group (Nicole LaForge, Micah Quindazzi) to relate biotoxin exposure and impacts to life stage and history (e.g. estuary residence time, age at entry) for specific populations (Sarita, Robertson), and with the eDNA group (Christoph Deeg et al.)  on interactions of juvenile WCVI Chinook salmon with harmful algae and other marine species.

In addition to providing total biotoxin concentrations, the analysis of filter and filtrate samples (Ross et al., 2025a) allows us to compare biotoxin levels in different salmon tissues with dissolved and particulate biotoxin concentrations in the surrounding water, and to see if the data support a particular pathway of exposure (e.g. uptake via ingestion would likely give a better correlation with particulate biotoxins whereas uptake via gills would likely correlate better with dissolved biotoxins).

The analytical tools used in this project (e.g. high performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry) provide a high degree of confidence in the measured concentrations of harmful algal biotoxins in sea water and fish tissues. However, the west coast of Vancouver Island is a highly dynamic environment while the lifecycles of anadromous fish like WCVI Chinook salmon extend beyond the 3-year timeframe of this PSSI project. Consequently, more data is needed to confirm our initial findings. Ideally, this would involve the collection and analysis of samples and data for at least another 2 years, work that is current planned for the CSRF Project “Linking climate variables to algal biotoxin production and impacts on Pacific salmon” (2025-26-11-07) which runs until March 31, 2028.","Remaining knowledge gaps include additional monitoring data with which to establish longer-term trends in biotoxin production in Barkley Sound and how these may relate to climate change. They also include future data on adult returns and indicators of health, recruitment, etc. for salmon that were exposed to the observed concentrations of biotoxins in Barkley Sound during this project (i.e. from July 2023 to November 2025). This will allow long-term risks associated with ‘carry forward’ impacts of biotoxin exposure to be assessed, along with any early marine life stage impacts revealed by gene expression analysis and/or biometric indicators of fish health in juvenile salmon during this project. 

Meanwhile, the findings of this project can be operationalized by incorporating information on the temporal and spatial distributions of harmful algal biotoxins in Barkley Sound (Figs. 1 and 2) into the scheduling of hatchery releases for different populations (Sarita, Robertston) based on knowledge of their migration behaviour (incl. salt water entry and estuarine residence times) to minimize biotoxin exposure and impacts in juvenile salmon. The observed relationships between biotoxin levels in fish tissues and dissolved, particulate and/or total biotoxin concentrations (Fig. 3) in the surrounding water can also be used to help identify pathways of exposure and evaluate current and future risks posed by measured and projected biotoxin concentrations to juvenile WCVI salmon in Barkley Sound.","Figure 1.

PSSI Science Project Reporting-hatchery feeds-BC_EE.docx,1/28/2026,2417,Optimization of feeds used in the hatchery production of Pacific Salmon,Dr. Erika Eliason; Dr. Ian Forster; Greig Oldford,Salmon Enhancement Program Hatcheries,"West Vancouver, BC",Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha),,First feeding to release,British Columbia,Stream-type and ocean-type chinook from Chilliwack River Hatchery,,,"Given that early marine survival can be very low for hatchery-reared salmonids, the present study investigated the effects of a transition diet on the smoltification, growth and survival of stream-type and ocean-type Chinook salmon during the transition from freshwater to seawater. 

Fish fed the transition diet did not show any apparent advantages over fish fed the control diet, in terms of smoltification (enzymatic activities of gill Na+, K+ ATPase), growth performance or survival. 

We do not recommend broadscale adoption of transition diets at DFO hatcheries at this time, given that they do not appear to be an effective way to improve early marine survival.","The main objectives of salmon hatcheries in Canada are to enhance wild populations and support salmon fisheries, but are often hindered by low early marine survival of salmon after release (Beamish et al. 2010, 2012). While low early marine survival can be attributed to various factors, smoltification [the morphological, behavioural, and physiological changes salmon undergo to enable them to adjust to the marine environment (McCormick 2012; Brauner and Richards 2020)], is potentially a major bottleneck. During smoltification, one of the key changes is elevated enzyme activities of gill Na+, K+ ATPase (NKA), which plays a crucial role in facilitating primary salt secretion at the gills (McCormick 2012; Brauner and Richards 2020). Both elevated gill NKA levels (McCormick and Saunders 1987; Stich et al. 2015b, 2015a) and high survival post seawater transition (Clarke 1982) are considered valid indicators of smoltification development of salmonids. 

In hatchery settings, a change in photoperiod (increasing daylength) can trigger smoltification, while  temperature (warming) can accelerate its development in salmonids (Clarke et al. 1989; Muir et al. 1994; Duston and Saunders 1995; Ban 2000; Strand et al. 2018). In addition, past studies have also reported that salt supplementation in the diet could facilitate smoltification development of salmonids (positive effects: Zaugg et al. 1983; Trombetti et al. 1996; Staurnes and Finstad 2000; Hanson et al. 2016); but also negative effects see: Trombetti et al. 1996; Hanson et al. 2016). Manipulating the diet represents a feasible and relatively simple approach to further improve the smoltification success and thus early marine survival of hatchery salmon in BC. In collaboration with the DFO Salmon Enhancement Program, the objective of the present study was to investigate the impact of a seawater transition diet (Adapt Flex-transition diet vs control diet), on the smoltification, growth and survival of stream-type (ST, typically resides in freshwater for >1 year prior to migrating to the ocean) and ocean-type (OT, typically resides in freshwater for <6 months) Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha ) during the transition from freshwater to seawater.","On March 18th 2025, stream type (ST) and ocean type (OT) Chinook salmon from Chilliwack hatchery were transferred to 200 L indoor tanks (N=4 tanks per treatment, per strain) at 10°C under natural photoperiod at Pacific Science Enterprise Centre (PSEC), in West Vancouver, BC. Fish were fed control diets to satiation 3-4 times daily until the start of the experiment. The experiment started on April 2, 2025 for ST Chinook (control: 4.96 ± 0.02 g, 7.58 ± 0.01 cm; treatment: 4.87 ± 0.05 g, 7.55 ± 0.03 cm) and April 30, 2025 for OT Chinook (control: 4.29 ± 0.03 g, 7.30 ± 0.02 cm), respectively. These timings were also around 5 weeks before the time when the fish would usually be released by the hatchery to begin their outmigration. Fish (N = 55 per tank for ST, and N = 50 per fish for OT; 4 tanks per diet treatment per life stage) were fed one of two diets to satiation daily during a 5 week growth trial in freshwater: control (BioClark’s Fry, 3.0 mm, Bio-Oregon, Canada) or treatment transition diet (Adapt Flex 3 mm, EWOS, Canada), which contained 5% NaCl, and additional other proprietary ingredients (e.g. an immunostimulant compound and mix of exclusive nucleotide). Fish were maintained on their treatment diets for an additional 34 days (ST) and 7 days (OT) until the seawater transition. The timing of the seawater transition was determined when the majority of the fish in experiment tanks showed visual cues of smolt transformation, specifically the development of silvering body colour, and fading of parr marks. The fish were transitioned to seawater over 1 day, and then all fish were fed the same control diet for 4 weeks, after which the experiment was terminated and all remaining fish were euthanized (TMS at 0.2 g/L).  

Fish were sampled for body size (mass and fork length) and gill Na+, K+ ATPase (NKA; 5 - 8 fish per tank per sampling time, except on day 0, when total 30 fish were sampled prior to tank stocking) on: (1) day 0; (2) after 5 weeks on the experimental diets in freshwater; (3) 1 day after seawater transition; and (4) after 4 weeks in seawater. The Specific growth Rate (SGR) for each replicate tank was calculated for 2 periods: (1) the 5-week freshwater trial; (2) from the end of freshwater trial to the end of the seawater trial, using the formula below: 

SGR (%) = [ln (F) – ln (I)] × 100 / T

Where I = initial mean fish weight per tank (g), F = final mean fish weight per tank (g), and T = experiment duration (days) 

Enzyme activities of gill Na+ K+ ATPase (NKA) were analyzed using methods as described by Mccormick (1993).  

Fish growth and gill NKA levels were analyzed using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) using Sigmaplot 14. A statistical level of 0.05 is considered significant, and all data were expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). 

Overall, there were no differences in the trends between OT and ST Chinook salmon. Survival was excellent for both ST and OT Chinook salmon throughout the entire study (>91% across Chinook strains and diet treatments; Table 1). As expected, gill NKA activity increased during the experiment, indicating that smoltification processes were progressing over time (Figure 1; significant main effect of sampling stage; ST p = 0.002; OT p<0.001). However, there were no differences in gill NKA levels between diet treatments (ST: p = 0.21; OT: p = 0.30). For growth, fish grew faster on the control diet compared to the transition diet, but only in freshwater (Figure 2; significant interaction between diet and sampling stage; ST: p < 0.001; OT: p = 0.028). In freshwater, control fish had significantly higher SGR than the treatment fish. However, in seawater, SGR were similar for both groups, when all fish were fed the same control diet. Notably, SGR levels were much lower (up to 50% reduced) in seawater compared to freshwater (Figure 2).","This study investigated the effects of a transition diet on the smoltification development, growth and survival of ST and OT Chinook salmon during the transition from freshwater to seawater with the overall goal to improve early marine life survival. Throughout the lab experiment, all fish appeared robust, as they were able to handle multiple handling and sampling events without showing obvious adverse effects such as post sampling mortalities. By the end of the study, regardless of the diet, both ST and OT Chinook salmon apparently smolted well, as indicated by the elevated Gill NKA levels after the experiment started (Fig. 1), and the high survival 24-h and 4-weeks post seawater transfer (Table 1). Moreover, the overall data trends are highly similar between ST and OT Chinook salmon, indicating that both life history types responded comparably to the diet treatment and seawater transfer. 

Overall, the results of this study showed no apparent advantage of using the transition diet over the control diet in rearing Chinook salmon. First, for each strain of Chinook salmon, fish fed both the transition diet and control diet reached very similar smoltification status in terms of gill NKA activities and exhibited high survival post seawater transition. Secondly, compared to the control diet, the transition diet did not show an advantage on fish growth performance. In fact, for both ST and OT Chinook salmon, the control fish grew significantly faster in freshwater (Figure 2), and this is also in agreement with other studies (Salman and Eddy 1988; Hanson et al. 2016). In the present study, the growth differences observed may be related to the fish appetite for the feed, which was reflected by the amount of food fed to reach visual satiation. Particularly for ST Chinook salmon, the control fish consistently displayed a bigger appetite for feeding, and were thus offered more feed than the treatment fish throughout the study; this behaviour might thus translate into the observed larger body mass gains in control fish than treatment fish. 

Despite high survival, transition to seawater resulted in compromised growth rates for both ST and OT Chinook salmon. While all fish were fed the same control diet in seawater, the SGR of all fish decreased to a similar rate of 1 – 1.08 % after 4 weeks in seawater (Figure 2); indeed, the SGR of control ST Chinook salmon, which was the highest in freshwater (2.11 ± 0.00% per day), had the largest reduction of almost 50%. This slower growth of Chinook salmon post seawater transfer has been reported by other studies as well (Clarke et al. 1981; Morgan and Iwama 1991). With the increased metabolic rate of Chinook salmon in increased salinity (Morgan and Iwama, 1991), the fish may thus have less net energy for supporting growth (Brauner and Richards 2020), resulting in slower SGR at this stage. While the seawater growth phase was only 4 weeks in the present study, these Chinook salmon might need more time to physiologically adjust for the seawater condition, before compensating for their growth. In a wild setting, elevated metabolic rates and incomplete smoltification processes leading to reduced SGR could contribute to early marine mortality. In this regard, sufficient estuary rearing areas could be pivotal to support smoltification processes, feeding opportunities and protection from predation during this critical transition stage (McNatt et al. 2016; Moore et al. 2016; Chalifour et al. 2021).

Interestingly, the smoltification development rates likely differed between the strains. At the start of the present study, the gill NKA levels (unit: μmol ADP·mg protein−1·h−1) of ST Chinook salmon (2.02 ± 0.26) are comparable to those reported from Chinook salmon at the beginning of river migration (mean 1.34 – 1.64; Ewing et al. 2001), while OT Chinook salmon (3.48 ± 0.22) had already reached a similar level of those caught in estuaries (3.8 ± 0.32; Ewing et al., 2001). This finding suggested that while OT Chinook salmon were held for 4 weeks longer until experiment start, they were also in more advanced smoltification development, which was also supported by fish morphology observation during initial tank stocking. After 4 weeks in seawater, the gill NKA levels of OT Chinook salmon were still higher than ST Chinook salmon (mean value of control and treatment; OT: 5.30 ± 0.24; ST: 3.78 ± 0.24); these levels are comparable to those of Chinook salmon smolt at early stage of seawater transfer at 34 ppt (mean around 4; Quinn et al. 2003), but lower than those observed after 10 days in seawater (mean: 6; Quinn et al. 2003). In fact, Houde et al. (2019) reported even higher gill NKA levels from Chinook salmon smolt both in freshwater (5.0 ± 2.5) and seawater (9.6 ± 2.8). 

It is possible that the positive effects of a transition diet on smoltification were masked by other factors, such as temperature. Increasing temperature has been reported to accelerate smoltification processes, in terms of earlier elevation and higher gill NKA activities in Atlantic salmon (Solbakken et al. 1994; Mccormick and Moriyama 2000; McCormick et al. 2002), Chinook salmon (Muir et al. 1994), and sockeye salmon (Ban 2000). In the present study, all fish experienced an increase of water temperature during transfer from the hatchery (5.8 ± 0.4oC for ST, and 7.4 ± 0.2oC for OT) to PSEC (10°C). Therefore, it is possible that smoltification development had already been accelerated soon after they were introduced to the holding tanks, before the experiment started. In this case, the effects of the transition diet may have been masked, as both control and treatment fish would show accelerated smoltification development. While the initial higher gill NKA levels of OT Chinook salmon discussed above, seemed to support this hypothesis, more concrete evidence are still needed. To mitigate the potential interference of a water temperature effect, future studies could design similar experiments so that the fish would not experience a significant change in water temperature, such as running the entire study at the hatchery as reported by Hansen et al. (2016).","We found no evidence to suggest that using seawater transition diets (Adapt Flex by EWOS Canada Ltd.) will improve early marine survival for hatchery fish. The results of the present study showed that there were no apparent advantages of using this seawater transition diet over the routine control diet on rearing ST and OT Chinook salmon in terms of smoltification, growth and seawater survival. Indeed, all these performance parameters measured in the present studies showed very similar trends between ST and OT Chinook. As such, we do not recommend broadscale use of these transition diets at DFO hatcheries at this time.

On the other hand, future studies are encouraged to investigate knowledge gaps revealed here. One recommendation is to conduct a similar study in a hatchery setting, in order to have the most direct insights into how a transition diet may benefit the hatchery production of salmon at DFO. Hatchery and lab conditions vary in several aspects, including water source, fish density, temperature, and rearing environment. In the present study, it was speculated that the inevitable change in water temperature from hatchery to the lab might have accelerated the smoltification development in both control and treatment fish, thus masking the effects of transition diet. Conducting a similar study in a hatchery setting could reveal the effects of the transition diet, while eliminating similar potential interfering factors that may exist in lab environment. Moreover, while the present study focused on growth and gill NKA as traditional development indicators, future studies could further investigate dietary effects on the physiological and behavioural performance parameters relevant to survival post hatchery-release. For example, swimming or migration performance (Pedersen et al. 2008; Serrano et al. 2009; Wilson et al. 2021), standard and maximum metabolic rates (Farrell 2009; Auer et al. 2015) and predator avoidance behaviours (Olla et al. 1998; Jackson and Brown 2011) are known to be critical to salmon survival in the early marine environment. Finally, given that the transition diet does not appear to be effective at improving early marine survival, we recommend considering how alternative diets could confer other desirable traits in fish, such as the possibility that high lipid diets could reduce the jacking rate in salmon.",See document attached.,"Auer, S.K., Salin, K., Anderson, G.J., and Metcalfe, N.B. 2015.

This project established thiamine analysis capability for fish tissues (e.g. eggs, plasma, muscle, liver) by the Nutrition lab at the DFO Pacific Science Enterprise Centre (PSEC).

Preliminary data discovered that total thiamine levels in eggs of both coho and Chinook salmon in BC generally ranged from 6 – 13 nmol/g, most pink Salmon contained 4 – 8 nmol/g, but most sockeye salmon eggs only contained 2 – 6 nmol/g, which suggests that some Pacific salmon populations in BC may exhibit TDC and warrant further monitoring.","Thiamine (Vitamin B1) is an essential water soluble vitamin for fish, supporting physiological functions such as metabolism, immune, neuron and cardiac functions (Bâ 2008; Manzetti et al. 2014; Roman-Campos and Cruz 2014; Whitfield et al. 2018), normal development (Carvalho et al. 2009), growth (Reed et al. 2023; Lee et al. 2026) and reproductive success (Fitzsimons et al. 2005; Honeyfield et al. 2005; Mantua et al. 2025). In aquatic systems, thiamine is synthesized by bacteria and phytoplankton at the base of the food web (Croft et al. 2007; Tang et al. 2010; Paerl et al. 2015; Hylander et al. 2024; Suffridge et al. 2024), and fish obtain thiamine exclusively through their diet (Fridolfsson et al. 2018; Harder et al. 2018; Ejsmond et al. 2019; Hylander et al. 2024). Thiamine deficiency complex (TDC) is a syndrome that is caused by a chronic deficiency in thiamine, impacting salmon across the life cycle. In adult salmon, reduced swimming and migratory ability, and increased pre-spawn mortality have been linked to TDC (Brown et al. 2005a; Fitzsimons et al. 2005). For early-stage salmon fry hatched from thiamine-deficient eggs, symptoms include loss of equilibrium (Fitzsimons et al. 2005), abnormal swimming behaviour (i.e. swimming in a corkscrew pattern) (Mantua et al. 2025), impaired vision and foraging ability (Carvalho et al. 2009), and high mortality (Koski et al. 1999; Mantua et al. 2025). TDC is caused by low availability of thiamine in the diet and/or ingestion of prey high in thiaminase (enzyme that degrades thiamine, Fisher et al. 1998; Brown et al. 2005a; Honeyfield et al. 2005; Houde et al. 2015; Mantua et al. 2025). Both extrinsic (e.g. changing environmental conditions, variation in the migration experience) and intrinsic factors (e.g. species, size, sex, disease state) could further modulate fish thiamine levels.

TDC has been linked to salmonid population declines globally, including Atlantic salmon Salmo salar in the Baltic Sea (Amcoff et al. 1999), lake trout Salvelinus namaycush in the Great Lakes (Ladago et al. 2020), and Chinook salmon in Alaska (Strasburger et al. 2023) and California (Mantua et al. 2025). However, there is little published information about the status of TDC in Pacific salmon, especially in British Columbia (BC), Canada (but see Welch et al. 2018). More research is thus urgently needed to investigate how thiamine status has been impacting Pacific salmon in BC, Canada. The objectives of this project were to: (1) establish thiamine analysis capacity at DFO to support studies and programs investigating the thiamine status of salmonids in Canada. Until this project, there were no Canadian labs providing thiamine analysis services, thus Canadian projects must rely on a few labs in the USA, creating a bottleneck (costly, delayed, sample loss risk) in thiamine analysis. (2) determine preliminary thiamine status in eggs collected from both wild and hatchery-derived stocks of Chinook salmon, coho salmon, pink salmon and sockeye salmon in BC. And (3) assess the effectiveness of thiamine treatment practices being tested at some DFO hatcheries. This research was conducted in collaboration with the Pelagic Ecosystem Lab at University of British Columbia (UBC), DFO Salmon Enhancement Program (SEP) and DFO Environmental Watch Program (EWATCH).","Thiamine analysis capacity was established by researchers in the Nutrition lab at the DFO Pacific Science Enterprise Centre (PSEC), based on the methodology of Brown et al. (1998) with expert advice from Dr. Jacques Rinchard from SUNY Brockport and Dr. Cody Pinger from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). To confirm the reliability of our analysis protocol, we analyzed 27 Chinook salmon egg samples collected in 2023 by Pelagic Ecosystem Lab at UBC and compared our results with those provided to UBC by the lab at SUNY Brockport. There was a strong and significant linear relationship (Fig 1; y = 0.8183 x – 0.4131) between SUNY Brockport and PSEC’s results on total mean thiamine levels (p < 0.001) providing confidence that the methodology employed by PSEC is reliable and accurate. Overall, PSEC reported consistently lower total mean thiamine levels, especially lower TPP levels, compared to SUNY Brockport. This is not surprising given that PSEC conducted the analysis in 2025, almost 2 years later than SUNY Brockport. Given the sensitivity of thiamine (temperature, light, pH; Brown et al. 1998; Wright et al. 2005; Edwards et al. 2017; Rocchi et al. 2022), thiamine degradation in tissues is expected to occur over time with prolonged storage and multiple sample handing events. 

Additional salmon samples from both hatcheries and the wild were collected to obtain baseline, preliminary data on the thiamine status of salmon in BC. Sample collection included: Chilliwack River hatchery coho salmon (N=10 females; eggs, plasma), Chilliwack River hatchery Chinook salmon (N=10 females; eggs, plasma), Capilano hatchery mid coho salmon (N=10 females; eggs), Harrison River sockeye salmon (N=10 females; eggs, ventricles, plasma), Chilko River sockeye salmon (N=10 females; eggs, ventricles, plasma), Weaver Creek sockeye salmon (N = 9, eggs, ventricles, plasma), Chehalis pink salmon (N = 11 females; eggs ). Tissues were immediately frozen (dry shipper or dry ice) and stored at -80oC until analysis. Ventricle and plasma analysis is ongoing, only egg data are presented here. Total thiamine levels were very similar in the Chinook and coho eggs assessed here (Figure 2), mostly ranging between 6 – 13 nmol/g. However, sockeye salmon eggs had much lower total thiamine levels of mostly 2 – 6 nmol/g, while total thiamine in pink salmon eggs mostly ranged from 4 – 8 nmol/g.  Using the thiamine thresholds as established by Mantua et al. (2025), 20 – 40% of each coho and Chinook salmon population are considered as being likely impacted by thiamine deficiency to some degree (< 7.7 nmol/g; Figure 3). However, all sockeye salmon samples are below 7.7 nmol/g, with over 50 – 100% of eggs considered having low (2.7 -5.9 nmol/g) or critically low thiamine (< 2.7 nmol/g) levels. For the Chehalis pink salmon population, 72% of samples are considered to be likely thiamine deficient (< 7.7 nmol/g), with 45% of eggs in the low category (2.7 – 5.9 nmol/g; Figure 3).  

To counteract the effects of TDC, thiamine supplementation is seen as an effective strategy to improve salmon reproduction success in hatcheries (Harder et al. 2025) and is currently implemented at a few DFO hatcheries. Current practices include injecting thiamine (500 mg thiamine hydrochloride) into broodfish ~12-25 days prior to spawning (Shuswap River hatchery) or immersing fertilized eggs in a static bath made of 1000 ppm thiamine mononitrate for 1 hour (Tenderfoot Creek hatchery, Capilano hatchery). We sampled thiamine-injection-treated eggs from Middle Shuswap Chinook salmon at Shuswap River hatchery (N=6, no control fish were available).We sampled both untreated (control) and thiamine-bath-treated eggs (immediately after the 1 h bath) from Cheakamus Chinook salmon at Tenderfoot Creek hatchery (N=4 females), early coho (N=20 females) , mid coho salmon (N=20 females) and late coho salmon (N=20 females) from Capilano hatchery. In addition, thiamine-bath treated eggs were sampled ~1 month post-fertilization in coho salmon from Capilano hatchery (N= 400 eggs each for early, mid and late Coho; eggs from different females were mixed; no control fish were available).

Thiamine injection-treatment (Middle Shuswap Chinook salmon at Shuswap River hatchery) produced eggs with total thiamine levels ranging between 16-27 nmol/g (Table 1). While there are no control fish for comparison, these levels are above egg thiamine levels in untreated eggs from other locations (Tenderfoot and Chilliwack hatchery Chinook salmon, Figure 2). This suggests that the thiamine injection treatment likely was effective at increasing total thiamine levels in the eggs. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of the thiamine bath treatment (Tenderfoot Creek hatchery and Capilano hatchery) could not be resolved here. Sampling eggs immediately following the 1 h thiamine bath treatment resulted in extremely elevated and highly variable total thiamine levels (range = 256.8 – 327.0 nmol/g). In fact, we were unable to determine accurate total thiamine levels for the bath-treated samples from Capilano, as the results were contradictory (i.e. varying from 0.95 – 291.20 nmol/g). While we reported consistently high total thiamine from bath-treated eggs from Tenderfoot Creek Hatchery, these levels are not biologically reasonable and were likely produced by excess thiamine associated with the bath. Given this, we sampled some eggs ~1 month post bath treatment from Capilano Hatchery and found levels to vary among batches (early coho batch#1: 0.90 ± 0.06, batch #2: 2.49 ± 0.60; mid coho batch#1: 3.86 ± 1.18; N=5 tests, unit = nmol/g). However, without control, un-treated eggs at the same life stage, we are unable to assess whether the thiamine bath treatment was successful at increasing thiamine levels in these eggs.","This project successfully established thiamine analysis capability at PSEC, which is currently the only known laboratory in Canada conducting these analyses. A detailed protocol outlining the equipment, consumables and procedural steps is available for distribution to other research groups at DFO to set up the same analysis capacity. Our lab at PSEC is currently welcoming thiamine analysis requests and collaborative projects to support research programs monitoring the thiamine status of Pacific salmon and their prey in Canada. 

The thiamine levels in coho and Chinook salmon eggs were within the expected range, consistent with previous work on Chinook salmon in Alaska (Honeyfield et al. 2016; Larson and Howard 2019) and California (Mantua et al. 2025), and preliminary data available for BC (Lerner and McLaskey 2024). Notably, the relatively wide range of thiamine levels suggests considerable variation among individuals within each population. Future studies should consider increasing the sample size from each population (i.e. >10 fish per population) to have a more precise estimate of salmon thiamine status. In contrast, the total thiamine amounts in sockeye salmon eggs from Weaver Creek, Harrison and Chilko River were less variable, but also had lower levels (mostly within 2 – 6 nmol/g). While the Harrison River samples were considered not fully ripe, the thiamine levels in these eggs were similar to those of fully ripe fish in Chilko River. Notably, a previous study found much higher total thiamine levels in eggs of sockeye salmon from Harrison River, and pink salmon from Seton River in 2015 (Sockeye: 10.9 ± 1.2 nmol/g, n = 5; pink: 19.5 ± 2.3 nmol/g, n=20; Welch et al., 2018). The cause of these differences in thiamine levels between studies of the same population conducted ~10 years apart is unknown, but may be related to changes in prey (and thus dietary thiamine/thiaminase levels), changing ocean or migration conditions or other factors not identified. 

Based on the thiamine thresholds by Mantua et al. (2025), 20 – 40 % of the eggs analyzed from each coho and Chinook salmon population in this study, are considered to be likely impacted by thiamine deficiency (Figure 3). However, the total thiamine in all eggs from sockeye salmon from both Harrison and Chilko River are well below this threshold, and only 27% of Chehalis pink salmon eggs were above it. It must also be noted that the threshold from Mantua et al. (2025) is set based on Chinook salmon, but the susceptibility to TDC, or thiamine threshold, is likely species-specific (Brown et al. 2005b; Fitzsimons et al. 2007; Honeyfield et al. 2008; Harder et al. 2018). To our knowledge, there are no published data on thiamine status of sockeye and pink salmon other than Welch et al. (2018). Future research should track thiamine status of Pacific salmon in BC, especially sockeye salmon. 

The broodfish-thiamine-injection method appeared to effectively improve the total thiamine levels, mostly in form of TH, in Chinook salmon eggs. Although there were no untreated, control eggs available as a comparison at Shuswap River Hatchery, the injection-treated eggs (20.5 ± 4.8 nmol/g, range from 16 - 27 nmol/g) contained up to 2 – 3 times the usual thiamine amount in untreated eggs of other Chinook salmon stocks (Figure 2 and 3, 6 – 13 nmol/g). The total thiamine levels in eggs from these injection-treated fish are within the range reported for similar studies on coho salmon (21.925 ±1.694 nmol/g, Fitzsimons et al., 2005) and steelhead trout Oncorhynchus mykiss (total thiamine 20.4 ± 11.3 nmol/g; Futia et al 2017; mean total thiamine: 33.5 nmol/g, range: 15.4 – 51.1 nmol/g; Reed et al 2023). Unfortunately, our study could not resolve the effectiveness of thiamine bath-treated eggs because of supra-biological and varying levels measured in eggs sampled immediately after the 1 h treatment bath (e.g. 302.5 ± 31.2 nmol/g in Chinook salmon at Tenderfoot Creek hatchery; 0.95 – 291.20 nmol/g in mid Coho salmon eggs at Capilano Hatchery). Thus, it was unknown how much of the thiamine was actually retained and biologically available to the eggs over time. Future work should resolve the effectiveness and necessity of these thiamine treatments, as these methods could prove highly valuable in both minimizing the potential negative impacts of TDC on early fry and optimizing hatchery salmon production (Futia et al. 2017; Reed et al. 2023; Harder et al. 2025).","With the thiamine analysis capacity established at PSEC, DFO can now further expand research relevant to thiamine and fish in Canada. First of all, more research is urgently needed to determine the status of TDC across stocks of all 5 species of Pacific salmon in BC and the Yukon, across the life cycle (especially adults and eggs). Second, we need to establish how thiamine levels vary across tissue types (e.g. muscle, ventricle, liver, plasma, eggs) and identify whether plasma thiamine levels could be used as a non-lethal indicator of adult salmon thiamine status. Third, we need to establish the thiamine and thiaminase status of the primary prey species in both ocean and freshwater habitats and how these may be changing over time. As such, a next step for the Nutrition lab at PSEC is to establish a protocol for thiaminase activity and begin collaborating with other groups to collect and assess prey. Fourth, we need to determine TDC thresholds for impairment for all 5 species of Pacific salmon species, in both eggs and migrating adults. Finally, we need carefully controlled experiments to assess the effectiveness and necessity of thiamine treatment (both bathing eggs and injecting broodstock) for hatcheries in BC.",See attached.,"Amcoff, P., Börjeson, H., Landergren, P., Vallin, L., and Norrgren, L. 1999.

Dr. Nicholas Bernier, University of Guelph

Dr. Fredrick Laberge University of Guelph",,Chinook,,smolt,Pacific,,,,"Main idea: Determine the usability of scale corticosteroids as biomarkers of chronic stress in Pacific salmon. 

Scale corticosteroid content can differ by underlying factors such as sex or life-stage. Furthermore, both cortisol and cortisone content rapidly increases in scales following a single acute stressor and returns to baseline levels within 72 hours. Both corticosteroids can also decrease at increasing rates while under chronic stress. Finally, the dynamics of scale corticosteroids can differ depending on the type of prolonged stress.

Implications: As scale corticosteroids can be elevated while plasma values are normal following acute stress, and the opposite can occur during chronic stress, we do not currently recommend using scale cortisol, nor cortisone, as biomarkers of chronic stress in Chinook salmon.","Exposure of fish to stressors can elicit physiological changes at multiple levels of animal organization, these alterations are collectively known as the stress response. The hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) axis which is activated in response to most forms of stress in fish, initiates and regulates the stress response. In fish cortisol is the predominant glucocorticoid released as part of the primary stress response, and is critical for mediating adaptive metabolic, physiological, and behavioral adjustments. However, prolonged elevation of cortisol, due to extended or repeated exposure to stressors, caused chronic stress that can negatively affect fish behavior, growth, reproduction, and immune functions (reviewed in Schreck and Tort, 2016). With respect to salmon, the period of parr-to-smolt transition (smoltification) is one of the most sensitive periods to stressors, with chronic stress resulting in impaired ability to smolt (Bernard et al., 2019; Vehanen et al., 2023).  For these reasons, there is a significant need to identify and validate biomarkers of chronic stress in different stages of Pacific salmon, which can be used identify and where possible control/manage factors lo reduce levels of chronic stress.

The analysis of circulating (serum/plasma) cortisol is the most common method used in stress response assessments in fish. This method works well under controlled situations, where fish can be caught and rapidly sampled (within minutes to avoid the rapid increase in cortisol which occurs in response to capture stress) and it provides information on the acute stress response at the time of collection (immediate state of stress).  To understand chronic stress the past cortisol history of individuals needs to be understood,  Unfortunately, due to how cortisol is physiologically regulated, circulating cortisol levels are well recognized as poor predictors of chronic stress (Aerts et al., 2015).

In higher vertebrates, measurement of cortisol in hair (Raul et al., 2004) and feathers (Macbeth et al., 2010), has been demonstrated to allow for retrospective assessment of levels of stress. Building upon these studies fish scales were identified as a biomaterial that accumulates cortisol, and other physiologically important hormones including cortisone, over long periods of time. The measurement of scale cortisol content was proposed as a way to determine past cortisol history in fish, and for use as a biomarker of chronic stress (Aerts et al., 2015; de Vrieze et al., 2012).  However, unlike hair and feathers in which cortisol levels remain fixed after deposition, the exchange of cortisol between the circulatory system and scales is an ongoing dynamic process, which is poorly understood,  Moreover, scale cortisol levels appear not to be affected by single acute stress events such as those associated with capture (reviewed in Laberge et al. 2019; Kennedy and Janz, 2023).

This project examined the usefulness of the measurement of scale stress hormone content (SSHHC) biomarker of chronic stress in Pacific salmon. Laboratory and hatchery-based studies were conducted to determine and validate/optimize: 1) sampling methods (e.g. study spatial heterogeneity of scale stress hormone content (SSHC)), 2) effects of acute vs. chronic stress on SSHC, 3) relationship between plasma and SSHC, 4) individual, stock and temporal variability in SSHC, including changes associated with smoltification, and 5) effects of unpredictable chronic stress on plasma and SSHC.

This project was in collaboration with the Bernier and Laberge labs at the University of Guelph. Gill homogenate NKA activity was measured by the BC Centre for Aquatic Health Sciences (Campbell River, BC, Canada).","Laboratory Studies

Scale preparation and extraction of corticosteroids followed the methods described by Laberge et al., (2019) with a few small modifications.  Preliminary studies were done to determine the number of scales required for analysis, as well as to examine whether scale cortisol concentrations varied across body regions.  

Using hatchery-reared juvenile Chinook salmon, three experiments were performed to assess the temporal profiles of cortisol accumulation and clearance in plasma and scales in response to stressors of varying intensity and duration: an acute stressor, three weeks of unpredictable chronic stress, and the transition from freshwater (FW) to seawater (SW) under elevated temperatures. Cortisone, the breakdown product of cortisol, was also quantified to determine whether whole animal and local cortisol metabolism contribute to scale cortisol levels and whether scale cortisol-cortisone ratios can be used for long-term stress monitoring.

Effects of Acute Stress on SSHC in Juvenile Chinook Salmon

Methods

Groups of juvenile Chinook Salmon were acclimated and held in 12.5 ºC SW. Following acclimation, undisturbed control fish were sampled to obtain baseline plasma and scale corticosteroid values. Experimental groups were subjected to a 1 minute air exposure.  Control groups were not handled. Plasma and scale samples collected from both groups at 1, 24, or 72 h post-stress were analyzed to determine levels of cortisol and cortisone.

Major Findings

As expected the acute handling stress (air exposure) resulted in the rapid increases in plasma cortisol and cortisone levels and the ratio of cortisol-cortisone (Fig. 1) These increases returned to baseline levels within 24 hours. 

Interestingly, a similar same pattern of increases in scale cortisol and cortisone levels was observed, with levels returning to baseline within 72 hours. Scale corticosteroid clearance lags behind clearance from plasma. The ratio of cortisol-cortisone followed a similar pattern returning to baseline within 24 hours. 

Interpretation:

Our results contradict the finding of Laberge et al. (2019) in goldfish, where the scales did not show an increase in cortisol content following the same acute air exposure stressor.  However, during our study McKinley et al. (2025) reported that scale cortisol content can increase within 30 min following an acute stressor in both goldfish and green sunfish. The difference in scale cortisol accumulation in goldfish observed between studies led McKinley et al. (2025) to suggests that underlying factors such as stressor exposure history and the cortisol concentration gradient between scale and blood may influence scale cortisol accumulation under acute stress.  This is an area where additional work appears to be warranted.

Scale cortisol concentrations are now commonly used as a biomarker of chronic stress, especially in populations of wild fish.  The majority of these studies have assumed that stress associated with capture has no effect on levels of scale cortisol.  Our work and the recent study by McKinley et al. (2025) provides evidence that this assumption is not necessarily true.  Future studies need to consider how acute stress during capture and the timing of their scale sampling relative to capture might inflate scale cortisol values.

Effects of Unpredictable Chronic Stress (UGS) in Juvenile Chinook Salmon

Methods

Juvenile Chinook Salmon were transferred into twelve experimental tanks and assigned into two treatments, control (6 tanks) or UCS (6 tanks).  Fish held in 12.0 ºC SW and acclimated for 3 weeks. Following acclimation, all tanks assigned to the UCS treatment group were exposed to one of the following randomly assigned stressors once a day for 3 weeks: holding out of water in a net for 1 min; chasing with a dip net for 10 min; holding in shallow water for 5 min. These stressors were applied at randomly assigned times (9 am, 12 pm, or 3 pm) to prevent anticipation of the stressor. Fish in the control groups were not handled. Scale and plasma samples were obtained from half of the fish from each tank (7-8 fish/tank) and treatment at 1, 2, and 3 weeks following the onset of UCS.  Sampling was conducted ~18 h after the last stressor exposure to avoid the influence of the last acute stress response on the measurements.

Major Findings

We found novel evidence that scale cortisol can decrease while plasma cortisol remains elevated under conditions of chronic stress (Fig. 2). Cortisol and cortisone levels in the plasma and scales of controls remained low throughout the experiment. Sustained elevation in plasma cortisol, along with the absence of growth in body size, during the UCS period, indicates that fish in the UCS group were chronically stressed. Despite this, scale cortisol levels in the UCS fish returned to baseline by week 3, indicating that a mechanism for cortisol clearance from the scales was engaged late in the UCS period. Interestingly, plasma and scale cortisone levels showed only a temporary elevation at week 1, suggesting high cortisone clearance rates earlier in the UCS period, potentially both in plasma and scales.

Interpretation

Our results differ from those reported for UCS studies in other species of fish  (Laberge et al. 2019; Aerts et al. 2015; Samaras et al. 2021; Kennedy and Janz, 2023). These studies reported that levels of scale corticosteroids remain elevated, or continually increase while under UCS, regardless of plasma levels.  More recently, McKinley et al. (2025) and Opinion et al. (2023) demonstrated that green sunfish and Atlantic salmon can acclimate to UCS by decreasing plasma and scale cortisol over time.  

This suggests that the dynamics of the corticosteroid responses to chronic stress in both plasma and scales varies among species of fish. Scale cortisol levels may be only a suitable biomarker for some species of fish. 

Our results also indicate that clearance of corticosteroids increased with time under stress, however, it is unknown the mechanism behind this.

Effects of Smoltification at Different Temperatures on Plasma and Scale Stress Hormone Content (SSHHC) in Chinook Salmon Smolts

Methods

In anadromous salmonids, the parr-to-smolt transition, which prepares juvenile fish to survive the migration from freshwater (FW) into seawater (SW), is more sensitive to environmental stressors than other life stages. As such, this study hypothesized that combined thermal stress and the transfer from FW to SW would induce chronic stress and increase scale cortisol content in Chinook salmon smolts. Control fish were kept in FW at 10oC, while experimental fish were acclimated (0.5oC/day) to 10, 12.5, or 15oC and then transferred to SW over 48h. Plasma, scale and gill samples were obtained from all groups at 1, 14 and 28 days post-transfer.

Major Findings

Following transfer to SW, especially at higher temperatures, plasma cortisol generally increased within treatments with time, especially in the highest temperature (12.5 and 15.0oC) treatments . Within treatments scale cortisol remained relatively constant over time, with the 15oC saltwater group having the highest levels at 1 and 14 days (Fig. 3). 

When compared to controls and other experimental groups plasma cortisone values were elevated in the 15oC seawater group, at 1 and 28 days (Fig 4A).  Scale cortisone was measured at higher levels than cortisol at all time periods.  Scale cortisone was highest in the 12.5 and SW15oC seawater treatments, with some evidence that levels declined with time. 

Neither gill NKA activity, nor plasma osmolality explain the differences observed in corticosteroid content.

Interpretation

In contrast to what we found in our unpredictable chronic stress study scale cortisol levels remained relatively constant over time in this study.  This suggests that scale corticosteroid dynamics may differ depending on the type, and temporal application of chronic stress.","Overall, this project has vastly elevated our understanding of scale corticosteroid dynamics and usability for Chinook (and Coho, to a lesser degree) salmon.

While scale cortisol content has been proposed as a reliable, retrospective look into the stress history of fishes, similar to hair (Koren et al. 2011) or feathers (Macbeth et al. 2010), our data shows that levels of corticosteroids in fish scales are far more dynamic than previously thought. 

In juvenile Chinook salmon, the measurement of scale corticosteroids has limited use as biomarkers of chronic stress, due to their susceptibility to acute stress, rapid clearance after acute stress, and the onset of a corticosteroid clearance response under prolonged chronic stress. Furthermore, both scale cortisone and the scale cortisol-cortisone ratio were found to be less consistent, more variable, and cleared faster than scale cortisol, and thus are unlikely to be better biomarkers of chronic stress than scale cortisol alone. Whether this is true for other species of salmon is unclear. 

Our results identify a number of factors necessary to consider when planning studies and/or evaluating/interpreting the results of previously published studies, to ensure that measured differences in scale corticosteroids are due to differences in how the fish are responding to their environment rather than being an artefact of study design.","There remains a poor understanding of: 1) mechanisms/pathways by which corticosteroids are deposited too and cleared from scales, 2) environmental and other factors which control rates of deposition and clearance of scale corticosteroids, 3) the extent to which there are species or sex-specific differences in these processes and 4) the physiological reasons for, and the importance of these processes, in maintaining fish homeostasis.  

Future research in all of these areas would make important contributions to our understanding the dynamics and role/s of corticosteroids in scales.

Based on this projects results we do not currently recommend using scale cortisol, or cortisone, as biomarkers of chronic stress in the management off and/or conservation efforts for Chinook salmon.","Figure 1.

Findings: We measured the otoliths of outmigrating Chinook and constructed FL-otolith radii regression relationships: determined that they were segmented break-point models and river system specific. We focused on PSSI priority WCVI systems: identified population specific patterns of estuary entry and residency for the Sarita, Nitinat, Stamp, Bedwell and San Juan systems.

Implications: Microchemistry analysis reveals that Chinook Salmon in each river system have a unique proportion of several life-history patterns, including whether they leave as fry or parr, use the estuary for an extended period of time or merely transit through it, and then either remain in the marine environment or return for a duration of time to their own or another river’s estuary.","Impetus: WCVI natural-origin (NO) Chinook are very important for the economic, social and cultural well being of many coastal communities, including First Nations, and both freshwater & marine ecological communities. Low early marine survival has been identified as a threat for rebuilding these stocks and has been understudied in NO Chinook

Knowledge gap: A method was needed to identify successful life-history types in returning adults in order to determine how best to rebuild them. Analysis of otolith microchemistry can fill this gap because otoliths are inert once incorporated and preserve chemical signals related to environmental patterns (e.g. transition from fresh to saltwater) unlike other tissues such as bone and scales. This means analyzing the chemistry across the otolith can reveal where salmon were through time at some size and stage.

Partnerships: Otoliths have been stored by DFO from collections undertaken by many programs including Stock Assessment and the more recent Follow the Fish program. Collaboration with these programs can provide a large archive of both current and historical otoliths to analyse microchemically and track the changes across the life spans of individual fish and the changes in life-history patterns of populations from past to present.","This project is the first to develop the capacity to use otolith microchemistry analysis by Laser Ablation-Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) internally within DFO. With the existing instruments and expertise housed in the Mass Spectrometry Lab at IOS, we have the capacity to microchemically analyse thousands of otoliths per year in a cost effective manner and use the life-history knowledge gleaned from them to inform fisheries and conservation policy. 

This technique involves polishing otoliths to expose the earliest layers, which are formed before the fish hatches, and then vaporising a line transect from the core to edge with a tiny, precise laser  connected to a mass spectrometer. The spectrometer counts and identifies the changing elemental composition of the otolith material over each fish’s life-span, and the timing of these changes can be calculated based on the known speed and position of the laser beam and applied to real world times and locations of relevance.

Findings: 

Otolith microchemistry of WCVI Chinook shows evidence for freshwater to marine carry-over effects

Most NO juveniles leave the estuary early and small as fry, but the small percentage of later, larger parr outmigrants have a much higher survival rate, although the proportions differ by year and river system

While hatchery origin (HO) outmigrants have a higher survival rate overall than NO outmigrants, the larger, later NO outmigrants survive better than their similarly sized HO counterparts

The largest, oldest returning spawners tend disproportionately to have been early, small outmigrants. Therefore, releasing hatchery juveniles as late, large outmigrants appears to be promoting the return of spawners as younger, smaller adults which may be driving follow-on effects such as lower fecundity, fewer eggs per female, smaller average egg sizes and increased competition for optimal redd sites.","Our research has really highlighted the need to address Pacific salmon stocks from the perspective of life history types, rather than as monoliths. By identifying what life-history types leave the river and what life-history types return, we can identify differential survival across these life-history types and start getting at what makes a successful Pacific salmon. This can improve Pacific salmon management by providing assessments of how habitat, such as freshwater rearing habitat, may improve the overall survival of stocks by allowing more members of the population to make use of a more successful life history type. We have also shown that there are different ages at return amongst life history types, which could improve management by addressing not only changes in survival, but changes in fitness. By addressing carry over effects of early life history decisions, we can start to better address where the bottlenecks to survival exist and how targeted restoration could be rolled out.","As we study more systems, it is clear that each system has its own unique set of circumstances. An early life history type that may be successful in Sarita may not be successful elsewhere. We have also found that brood year specific analyses are more helpful to pinpoint certain problematic years which can then be investigated further to find a cause. We are working on finishing up these reports on various systems highlighted above, as well as working with other members of FTF to provide details about how these carry over effects may be manifesting in biological data we already have collected.","Figure 1.

Modern tools and approaches for tracking and assessing these threats are needed to support responsive and integrated regulatory, planning, partnership, and monitoring activities to help safeguard fish and fish habitat.

We developed geospatial estimates of individual and cumulative threats to salmon and Species At Risk habitat in the Fraser River Basin from human activities, landscape disturbance, and climate change (e.g. pollutant loading, sedimentation, flow alteration, high stream temperatures). We modelled and mapped 13 threats for the full stream network and identified where and for which species threats were higher. We further applied the threat scores and indicators of important habitat for salmon in the Thompson-Nicola to help inform restoration planning for salmon ecosystems.

This project is the first to provide spatially extensive estimates of freshwater threats to salmon and inform how restoration and management actions can potentially improve population outcomes. The estimated threats are now used in salmon population life-cycle modelling to evaluate the impact on salmon across their freshwater life cycle.","Understanding where and how fish and fish habitat are impacted by human activities and climate change is critical information for targeting effective conservation and management actions to help preserve populations. Geospatial cumulative effects assessments offer a powerful approach for evaluating simultaneous threats across large spatial scales, improving upon traditional field-based assessments (Halpern et al. 2008a; Halpern and Fujita 2013). However, many existing assessments rely on simple proxies of human activity (e.g., road density) rather than mechanistic metrics that directly link stressors to ecological responses relevant to fish and fish habitat (e.g., sediment loading or flow alteration) to provide more meaningful applications (e.g., stressor-response curves; Rosenfeld et al. 2022). To address this gap, this project advanced existing geospatial tools, indicators, and threat metrics for the Pacific Region (DFO 2022) by incorporating a mechanistic approach to better quantify anthropogenic and climate change impacts and inform management actions for salmon and Species at Risk (SAR) in the Fraser River Basin (FRB).

The Thompson-Shuswap and Nicola River watersheds were identified as pilot areas to deliver Integrated Planning for Salmon Ecosystems (IPSE) under the Pacific Salmon Strategy Initiative (PSSI). Within the scope of this project, we conducted a case-study on the Thompson-Nicola Ecological Drainage Unit (EDU) by developing examples of how individual and cumulative threat scores can be applied to help inform restoration prioritization and management actions. The Thompson-Nicola spatial analysis was used to inform IPSE collaborative planning processes in the Thompson-Nicola watersheds.","We developed a geospatial tool to summarize anthropogenic and climate change related cumulative threats to freshwater species and habitats using open-source input data and software that can be reproduced for different time periods and freshwater species and their habitats. All threats were estimated for each stream reach within the BC Freshwater Atlas (FWA). We derived nine individual human-activity and landscape disturbance threats: aquatic invasive species, riparian disturbance, in-stream habitat destruction, flow alteration, latitudinal fragmentation, sedimentation, pollutant loading, and nutrient loading. The input data was processed and combined to produce an individual threat score that characterizes the mechanism of disturbance to freshwater species for each score. For climate change threats, we compiled model outputs of projected stream flow and temperature to estimate threats of flood-risk, low and high stream flow, and high summer stream temperature from 2040-2060 under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. The individual threat scores were standardized across the study area, weighted equally, and added together to calculate a human activity and landscape disturbance cumulative threat score and a climate change based cumulative threat score (see Iacarella et al. 2025 for detailed methods). Finally, both cumulative threat scores were paired with salmon and SAR distributions (i.e., CU boundaries and delineated stream habitats, respectively) and evaluated to identify where threats were greatest and which species and CUs were exposed to the highest threat levels.

For the Thompson-Nicola EDU case study, we focused on human activity threats that may reasonably be mitigated, including riparian disturbance, water withdrawal, and longitudinal fragmentation from dams. We identified overlap between these threats and two approaches used to identify areas important to salmon: (1) CU delineations and (2) modelled environmentally favourable spawning habitats. The modelled environmentally favourability predictions were derived from large-scale environmental niche models to predict shifts in habitat favourability from current to future climate conditions (Iacarella and Weller 2023). We multiplicatively combined threat scores with environmental favourability for salmon spawning to create composite scores that reflect a gradient of potential management implications (see Fig. 20 in Iacarella et al. 2025). A high threat score combined with a high favourable habitat probability identifies an area that warrants localized investigation and potential restoration or mitigation actions. Conversely, a low threat score combined with a low favourable habitat probability identifies an area that is less likely to need management attention based on salmon values (i.e., predicted spawning habitat) and low level of anthropogenic impact. 

Our results indicated the highest cumulative threat scores around the lower Fraser River and within the interior plateau of the FRB for both human activity and landscape disturbance based threats and climate change based threats (Figure 1). Watershed groups with the highest median cumulative threats were the Nicola River, Guichon Creek, and San Jose River. These heightened scores were predominately driven by riparian disturbance, nutrients, and sedimentation for the human activity based threats and high stream temperatures for the climate change based threats. Roads were the most frequent input that influenced human activity based threats across the FRB, and contributed consistently to in-stream habitat destruction, riparian disturbance, nutrients, and sedimentation. Other important inputs to these threats were forest fires, forest pest defoliation, rangeland, and forestry. We found that SAR with limited ranges (i.e., Coastrange Sculpin, Green Sturgeon, Nooksack Dace, and Salish Sucker) had higher median human activity cumulative threat scores relative to all streams in the FRB, corresponding to their at risk status (Figure 2). Median human activity threat scores tended to be more similar among salmon CUs and relative to all streams, though a few of the Threatened and Endangered Sockeye salmon CUs had notably higher median threat scores (Figure 2). 

	Within the Thompson-Nicola EDU, median cumulative threat composite scores within watershed groups based on the multiplicative value of human activity cumulative threats and favourable spawning habitat under current and future conditions were highest for Sockeye (Figure 3). The greatest shifts in median composite scores from current to future climate conditions (i.e., based on changes in predicted spawning favourability), were increases in Upper North Thompson River for Chinook (median score change = 0.14), Bonaparte River for Pink (0.06), and Deadman River for Sockeye (0.11), and a decrease in Thompson River for Coho (-0.06). Overall, the Deadman and Adams River watershed groups were identified as having the highest cumulative composite scores under current and future climate conditions across salmon species in the EDU.","This project is the first to provide spatially extensive estimates of human activity and climate change threats that are directly linked to salmon, SAR, and their habitats at the stream reach scale. The approaches used to estimate each of the indicators provide an initial broad-scale standardized framework that can be applied to characterize threats throughout the Pacific Region. Within the FRB, we observed the highest threats in the Lower Fraser and interior plateau, and specifically, within the Nicola River, Guichon Creek, and San Jose River. Overall, roads were the greatest contributor to human activity-based threats, disturbing in-stream habitats, riparian areas, and contributing to sediment and nutrient loading. These results improve our understanding of the spatial distribution and relative magnitude of threats across the FRB, providing a foundation for predicting population-level impacts from cumulative effects and life-cycle modelling. 

               A major source of uncertainty is the spatial accuracy of the BC Freshwater Atlas. Known issues to the FWA include overestimates of headwater streams in interior regions, misaligned stream delineations and large river catchment areas. Each of the individual threat scores have their own uncertainties and limitations, as detailed in Table 2 of Iacarella et al. (2025). In general, the input data are subject to limitations arising from potentially misclassified land cover or land use, features included in datasets but not present on the landscape, and unmapped activities or features, which introduce uncertainty into individual threat scores and the cumulative score. An additional source of uncertainty is the unresolved habitat use and distribution of salmon and SAR within the FRB. The approach used to combine individual threats into a cumulative threat score (e.g., addition, multiplication, etc.) is another source of uncertainty that can be evaluated in future work by modelling population responses to individual and cumulative threats.","Although our threat estimates represent the mechanisms by which salmon and freshwater SAR are affected, the magnitude at which these threats influence salmon population dynamics remains unknown. To address this gap, we are continuing to refine existing threat estimates and developing new threats that are explicitly linked to stressor-response functions for cumulative effects and life-cycle modelling. For example, we have developed additional riparian disturbance metrics that better capture the impacts to riparian function (e.g., large-woody debris recruitment, disturbance to stream-shading, riparian filtering), which were not included in the original report. Moreover, we are developing a stage-structured population model for Interior Fraser Coho (IFC) to estimate how stressors (estimated threats) are influencing the population across their freshwater life stages. For this work, we are utilising the Cumulative Effects Model for Prioritizing Recovery Actions (CEMPRA),  which applies stressor-response functions to account for the impact of stressors on vital rates and the overall population overtime and under different climate change and mitigation scenarios (Bayly et al. 2024). 

       Additional next steps for this work include expanding the cumulative threats model to other watersheds in the Pacific Region. To date, the model has also been applied to the Upper Bulkley Watershed to aid in salmon habitat restoration planning. Validation is an important step of most modelling exercises, though is often not a standard component of cumulative effect assessments (Halpern and Fujita 2013). Validating these threats through field verification and in situ data would be beneficial for threats that involve applied relationships and estimations, such as the flow accumulated loadings (i.e., nutrients, pollution, sedimentation). Future work could re-run the model at regular intervals to evaluate change in threats over time. Finally, additional analyses could quantify uncertainty in modelled threats and evaluate underlying assumptions through sensitivity tests.","Figure 1.

This project tests the hypothesis that early marine survival of Sakinaw Sockeye is negatively impacted by local predation at the Hodgson Island pinniped haul-out shortly after smolts enter the marine environment. If correct, smolts transported via boat past Hodgson Island, into Malaspina Strait, would have higher marine survival than smolts that outmigrate from Sakinaw Lake and pass the haul-out on their own. Marine survival is assessed by comparing the adult returns from PIT tagged transported smolts and hatchery PIT tagged fry and smolts released in the lake.

Key Findings:

PIT tagging sample size objectives were achieved (1000-2500 tags)

* Infrastructure issues at the Sakinaw Lake dam prevented enough smolts from being trapped for the project.

Transporting via aerated tanks on a boat is a successful method for moving smolts past the pinniped haul-out (Hodgson Island). Survival to release was over 99% and release condition and behavior was observed to be excellent.

Marine survival comparisons are still being monitored, with the 2024 transport group returning as adults in summer 2026. Preliminary results from the 2023 transport group indicate that survival was not improved for the transported smolts, with only 1 PIT tagged transport fish returning to the lake as an adult.

Implications: 

Early marine survival may not be the limiting factor for this population. If transport returns continue to be low in the 2026 adult return, the recommendation would be to not pursue smolt transport as a restoration tool for Sakinaw Sockeye. See Insights and Next Steps for more detail.","Sakinaw Sockeye have been listed as endangered with COSEWIC since 2003, and a Species at Risk Act Recovery Potential Assessment (RPA) was completed in 2017 (Ramshaw et al. 2019). The RPA cited low marine survival as the greatest limiting factor in recovery, with predator abundance and assumed predation on smolts and adults ranked as high risk, with a critical level of impact. Perpetually low marine survivals are preventing recovery such that the persistence of the population is entirely dependent on a captive brood program.

Sakinaw Sockeye smolts out-migrate from Sakinaw Lake each spring into the Malaspina Strait and Strait of Georgia. Localized marine predation is considered a major limiting factor for the survival of this stock. On water surveys (since 2019) of pinnipeds from the estuary to the seal haul-outs on Hodgson Islands (approximately 2km from the estuary, Figure 1) have observed approximately 100-350 harbour seals in the area during the spring out-migration. 

This project was started as a pilot (2022) in collaboration with shíshálh Nation to test the hypothesis that the Hodgson Island harbour seal population is negatively affecting smolt survival, and subsequently adult returns. The goal of the project is to transport and release smolts past the seal haul-out and then compare marine survival rates between transported smolts and those out-migrating naturally. The pilot project began with a low number of smolts transported in small trial releases to test the effect of handling, Passive Integrated Transponders (PIT) tagging, and increased osmoregulation on fish.

 

The initial proposal indicated a minimum of 1,000 and up to 2,500 PIT tagged sockeye are recommended per year such that a 1% survival will yield a total of 10-25 tag returns.  Return rates of less than 1% may be too low to justify operationalizing this activity long term.  Return rates for smolts entering the estuary naturally are well documented through annual census programs so additional tagging of a control group is not necessary.","Methods

All sockeye smolts outmigrating from Sakinaw Lake encounter a smolt fence with a slide and overhead camera. A portion or all smolts can be directed into a trap box (6x6x3’ aluminum framed) depending on slide configuration (Figure 2). For the purpose of this project the slide was set to 100% capture to meet tagging goals. 

Smolts were tagged with Biomark APT12 PIT Tags (12 x 2.12 mm, 0.1 g). Following sedation with TMS (Tricaine methanesulfonate), the tags are injected into the body cavity with an individual pre-loaded 12-guage needle and a Biomark MK 25 implanter. Tagged fish were then scanned and recorded via Biomark BioLogic DCM digital board, Biomark hand scanner, and a bluetooth connected tablet (Figure 3). Tag insertion and fish handling techniques described in the Columbia River PIT Tag Marking Procedures Manual (Columbia Basin Fish & Wildlife Authority PIT Tag Steering Committee, 1999) were modified slightly. As per recommendations from the DFO Veterinarian, the procedure for tagging was to insert the needle ahead of the pelvic girdle along the midline and inject the tag forward. Air bubblers and ice were used in each tagging bin to keep water temperatures cool and well oxygenated. Following tagging, smolts were returned to the trap box for recovery. 

Smolts were held in recovery for a minimum of three hours before the transportation process began. At high-tide, shíshálh Nation’s 30’ Landing Craft was brought into the estuary, where six large plastic garbage bins on board were filled with saltwater and frozen water bottles (500ml). At the smolt fence & trap box, eight waterproof backpacks (dry bags) were filled with ~5 gallons of water and 50 smolts (Figure 4). Smolts were carried 900 m down to the beach, where they were transported to the Landing Craft via 12’ skiff with electric motor. Smolts were then poured into the garbage bins with 20 mg/L of O2 from an oxygen tank (Figure 5). Smolts were then transported and released in the Malaspina Strait. 

Key Results

PIT tagging sample size objectives were achieved (1000-2500 tags). It was determined that sample size objectives could be met during the peak of smolt outmigration under normal operating conditions, as seen in 2023 & 2024, with the number of fish PIT tagged exceeding the goal of 2500 (Table 1).  

Transporting via aerated tanks on a boat is a successful method for moving smolts past the pinniped haul-out (Hodgson Island). Survival to release was over 99% and release condition and behavior was observed to be excellent.

Challenges included high water temperatures during tagging and transport. This was mitigated with ice and a start date earlier in May.

Marine survival comparisons are still being monitored, with the 2024 transport group returning as adults in summer 2026. Preliminary results from the 2023 transport group indicate that survival was not improved for the transported smolts, with only 1 PIT tagged transport fish returning to the lake as an adult.","This project was an exploration of new options to restore the Sakinaw Sockeye population to a self-sustaining run.  It was conducted at a pilot scale to avoid making large investments in equipment or infrastructure before understanding the effectiveness of smolt transport as a tool to increase adult returns.  

Given the timelines of the project in relation to the biology of the population we don’t yet have all of the results in hand.  Preliminary findings from the first group of ~2,600 smolts suggests this is not an effective tool at increasing survival due to low (1) returns in 2025.  A second cohort of over 5000 tags is expected to return in summer 2026 and will confirm these results.  

Assuming a similarly low return in 2026 the recommendation is to not pursue smolt transport as a restoration tool for Sakinaw Sockeye.  If the results are taken at face value they do raise some important discussion points and potential future directions.   For example, early marine survival may not be the limiting factor for this population and later stage mortality may be more important than previously thought.  Further investigations should focus on the hypothesis that late stage mortality is an important factor for this population based on the known milling behavior in the terminal area.   It has been well documented that Sakinaw Sockeye adults school and stage in the bay while waiting for optimal migration conditions.  These are typically described as a high tide at night with sufficient water levels which only occur on specific days within key migration months (e.g. July).   Prolonged staging could be exposing this population to higher levels of predation than for example Fraser bound Sockeye and should be specifically evaluated.

Moreover; stock composition data from the Johnstone Strait test fishery indicate Sakinaw Sockeye are regularly encountered each season.   Although numbers are low (<10/yr) the probability of this occurring should be near zero when comparing current escapements (low hundreds) to Fraser River run size (low millions; or 1 in 10,000).  This suggests there are more adults enroute to Sakinaw than expected providing additional support for the above hypothesis.","Following the recommendations above, here are a few directions to go with respect to future work:

Revisit Sockeye test fishing data and conduct a run reconstruction to estimate the pre-terminal abundance of Sakinaw Sockeye relative to escapement.  

Work with test fishing crews in 2026 to scan some or all of the test fishing catch with a PIT antenna as sets are spilled during enumeration (underway).  Tags in adults should be at a maximum this year and any IDs detected can be compared to results from the river to estimate survival.

Increase monitoring of staging behavior in the bay particularly in the month of July (peak season).  Consider installation of fixed SONAR stations in the bay to look for evidence of predation, particularly at night as fish attempt river entry.  Overhead camera installations with zoom capability may also be useful.

Consider PIT tagging clipped adults in the test fishery to test the above hypothesis.  This should be combined with DNA sampling to ensure they are Sakinaw origin fish.   Alternatively; consider applying acoustic tags and receivers to see where mortality is occurring.  Sakinaw Sockeye may stand out in the catch given their relatively small size and adipose clip.  Dip netting individuals out of the bunt could be explored.  Sorting entire sets is not feasible unless the boat is chartered specifically for that activity. 

At this time the recommendation is to avoid operationalizing smolt transport activities to support recovery of Sakinaw Sockeye.  It also brings into question the utility of similar activities that are designed to mitigate high early marine survival (e.g. net pens).","Table 1: The number of PIT tagged and transported Sakinaw Sockeye Smolts each year of the project and the dates of releases.

Fine temporal scale monitoring in nearshore coastal areas of Barkley Sound revealed year-long habitat use by juvenile salmon, with clear pulses in late Summer and early Fall.

These juvenile salmon densities are linked to densities and availability of euphausiids.

Competition and predation pressures from other fish species (Pacific herring and demersal predators like walleye pollock/Pacific hake) are present year-round and are found near surface water at night (co-occurring with juvenile salmon). Predation events from birds/marine mammals have been recorded multiple times at these sites, and did not appear to be density dependent.","Fisheries acoustics can be used to answer a number of questions related to Salmon ecology and dynamics. On large spatial scales, acoustic surveys are used to assess salmon prey (e.g forage fish and krill) conditions along the BC coast, identify prey hotspots, and assess changes in productivity through time. On a finer temporal scale, moored autonomous echosounders can provide information on juvenile salmon coastal habitat use, in conjunction with prey availability and predation pressures.

Autonomous echosounder system were used to address key elements affecting juvenile salmon during the first stage of marine life, including the timing of juvenile salmon use of coastal areas (time spent in key areas and within the water column), the prey conditions (e.g. euphausiids dynamic) they encounter in these areas, and the competition and predation pressures that affect them.","We used active acoustics methods as a remote sensing tools to assess the salmonsphere (salmon as well as their prey and predators). Large scale fisheries acoustic surveys conducted along the BC coast over the continental shelf and slope are used to assess marine conditions and the abundance and distribution of key prey species for adult Chinook salmon (e.g. Pacific herring and euphausiids). On a finer temporal scale, we used moored inverted echosounders to monitor juvenile salmons (and salmonsphere ecosystem components) in coastal areas within Barkley Sound.

Two autonomous systems were moored on the bottom of Barkley Sound nearshore areas with the transducers facing upward toward the sea surface, detecting juvenile salmon and all marine organisms as they go through the acoustic beam. Previous work in coastal areas using direct sampling methods (e.g. purse seine) combined with such moorings, as well as libraries of acoustic-trawl surveys and frequency-based signal processing techniques is enabling the classification of acoustic backscatter into species group (juvenile salmon, Pacific herring, walleye pollock and similar demersal fish, euphausiids) to obtain fine scale temporal data on their prevalence and relationship over more than a year of continuous data collection. In addition, surface predation events (from diving birds and/or marine mammals) are documented for the entire time-series. Acoustic methods are not capable of identifying juvenile salmon to species. To achieve species-specific interpretations the data will rely on other available sampling and ancillary data (seine, micro-trolling, eDNA, hatchery release timing) to further partition the acoustic information that was attributed to juvenile salmon.","Large spatial scale acoustic data have revealed persistent hotspots of euphausiids (a key salmon prey) along the BC coast – expansion of this work will include key forage fish species.

Moorings in nearshore coastal areas of Barkley Sound reveal the presence of juvenile salmon year-round, but having a clear pulse of activity and density in Late summer-early Fall. Although juvenile salmon have been detected throughout the top 50 m of the water column, they predominantly occupy the top 15-20 m of the water surface.

Pulses of juvenile salmon were closely linked to the availability and density of a key prey, euphausiids (krill). Krill display distinct diel vertical migrations (prey are at depth during the day and near surface at night).

Key competitors (Pacific herring) and fish predators (walleye pollock and/or Pacific hake) are present throughout the year, and also exhibit diel migration (mixing with juvenile salmon in the surface layer at night).

Further predation pressure from birds and/or marine mammals were identified throughout the time-series (documented daytime surface attacks), and does not appear to be density dependent, with many events occurring in the Winter when fewer surface schools are observed.","This study was implemented in the second year of PSSI. Acoustic data collected from moored systems are only available once instruments are recovered, in as such, we are just finalizing the processing and analyses of  these acoustic data – integration with other sampling (micro-trolling, eDNA, etc) that occurred while the instrument were collecting data will be a critical step to fully interpret these data and publish the findings.","Figure 1.

Fine temporal scale monitoring in nearshore coastal areas of the Strait indicate low abundance of juvenile salmon compare to juvenile Pacific herring, suggesting high levels of competition for food.

The nearshore moorings (including cameras) revealed a wide array of potential predators for juvenile salmon, but surface predation from birds and/or marine mammals were not as frequent as observed in nearshore coastal areas of Barkley Sound.

Deeper mooring in the central Strait of Gorgia revealed that Pacific hake (predators) were present almost year-round.","Fisheries acoustics can be used to answer a number of questions related to Salmon ecology and dynamics. On large spatial scales, acoustic surveys are used to assess salmon prey (e.g forage fish and krill) conditions within the Salish Sea, identify prey hotspots, key predators of juvenile salmon, and assess changes in productivity through time.

On a finer temporal scale, we used moored inverted echosounders to monitor juvenile salmons (and salmonsphere ecosystem components) in nearshore habitats and within the larger Strait of Georgia basin.

This project used the same methods as described for project 2432. More specifically, two autonmous echosounders were moored on the bottom near Departure Bay and French Creek as part of a separate project focused on Pacific herring in 2022-2023. These data were re-analyzed to identify juvenile salmon and associated species. Another mooring was deployed in 2024 in the middle of the Strait of Georgia to assess ecosystem conditions in the deeper larger basin, to provide insight on the dynamic of key salmon prey species (euphausiids) and piscivorous predators (e.g. Pacific hake). Another echosounder mooring was deployed in Malaspina Strait in 2025 (but these data are not available yet).","Large spatial scale acoustic data have revealed an increasing biomass of Pacific Hake throughout the Strait, with likely increased predation pressure for juvenile salmon, a sharp contrast to the West Coast, where Pacific hake biomass has drastically dropped over the past years.

Moorings in nearshore coastal areas revealed the presence of juvenile salmon year-round, but in relatively low abundance. The nearshore habitat in the Salish Sea was largely dominated by Pacific herring (suggesting juvenile salmon are exposed to much higher competition for food). 

Potential predators of juvenile salmon were observed routinely on the moored acoustics as well as on regularly moored camera systems. Surface predation from birds and/or marine mammals were also observed, but far less frequently than on the West Coast (Barkley Sound).

Moored autonomous echosounder in the central part of the Strait of Georgia further indicated that large predators (Pacific hake) were in the area for most of the year, and there was a strong seasonal signal of euphausiids and epi and mesopelagic communities in the Spring/Summer.","This study was implemented in the second year of PSSI.

PSSI Science Project Reporting chum gsi sogfra_final.docx,1/28/2026,2436,Chum whole genome sequencing for improved stock delineation,"Tigano, Anna; Rondeau, Eric; Healy, Timothy; Wellband, Kyle.",N/A,"PBS, Nanaimo, BC",Chum,"Fraser, Strait of Georgia, Puget Sound",Spawning adults,Southern BC and Puget Sound/Hood Canal,,,"Fraser, Howe and Georgia Strait – Southern Fjords",,"GSI is routinely used in the Northeast Pacific to inform the management of Pacific salmon species, especially chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka), coho (Oncorhynchus kisutch), and chum (Oncorhynchus keta). Of these four species, chum is the most widely distributed in the Pacific Ocean, and displays the weakest population structure across its range. Chum is managed jointly by Canada and the United States under the Pacific Salmon Treaty to ensure that the fishery is sustainable on the long term, and GSI has become a pillar of effective stock assessment and management. Bilateral efforts between Canada and the USA have led to the development of GSI panels in each of the two countries, with bilateral collaboration ensuring a large overlap of SNPs between the panels developed in the two countries to foster exchange of data and results. The Canada chum GSI panel consists of 535 SNPs originally sourced from a series of RAD-seq (a genomic method to genotype thousands of genome-wide SNPs) studies targeting different parts of the range, but limited to Washington and Alaska (to be refined Small et al PSC report, Mckinney et al. 2020; Mckinney et al. 2022), and subsequently optimized independently from the USA counterpart. The Canadian baseline, the genetic database used as reference to assign samples of unknown origin to their stock of provenance, includes genotypic data for over 32,000 individuals from 384 collections across the species range (October 2025). 

Despite the genotyping efforts, some areas in southern BC remain poorly resolved, with two areas being of particular interest: the lower Fraser and SOG. In the Fraser, the Albion test fishery, which provides crucial information on chum returns for stock assessment, relies on accurate separation of Chilliwack River returns from the rest of the Fraser, but it is currently challenging. To avoid misassignment and increase accuracy, albeit at the cost of resolution, all collections from the Fraser are lumped into a single reporting unit. In the Strait of Georgia, two main reporting units are currently recognized: Howe-Burrard, including collections from Howe Sound and Burrard Inlet; and Strait of Georgia, including collections from the west and east side of the strait that are not included in the Howe-Burrard reporting unit. Even though assignment accuracy between these two reporting units is low with the current SNP panel, the analysis of the baseline samples suggest that additional efforts may help discriminate collections from the east and the west side of the Strait, thus increasing overall resolution in the SOG.","We used whole genome sequencing to fully characterize genome-wide sequence variation within the Fraser, SOG and adjacent areas, including Puget Sound, Johnstone Strait, and West Coast Vancouver Island. We sequenced 15 individuals from each of 45 collections in these areas (Fig.1), and called variants using stringent quality filters. We identified more than 11 million SNPs (excluding rare variants) across 594 individuals, which is 21,000X the number of SNPs included in the current GSI panel (535 SNPs). We performed Principal Component Analyses (PCAs) to investigate population structure. Analyses based on 100,000 randomly selected SNPs, a subsample of the full catalogue of genomic variation, showed great resolution improvement compared to the reference baseline including data from the 535 SNPs of the GSI panel (Fig.2): the Fraser, SOG and Puget Sound were markedly differentiated from each other, the North Puget collections were clearly separated from the rest of the individuals, and we started to observe differentiation between Chilliwack and Fraser, and SOG east and west. More focused analyses including only Fraser-Chilliwack or SOG samples revealed significant differentiation within those two areas. To identify a set of highly informative SNPs to add to the GSI panel, we calculated FST, a measure of genetic differentiation, across all SNPs within each of the two areas and selected the 100 SNPs showing the highest differentiation in each area (Fraser and SOG). 

We extracted the genotype data from the whole genome sequencing dataset for the SNPs in the GSI panel and the 200 highly differentiated SNPs in the Fraser and the SOG. 121 of the 535 SNPs in the GSI panel were not present in the whole genome dataset because they were either excluded due to quality and/or low minor allele frequency filters, or because they were not variable in the target geographic area. Using Leave-One-Out (LOO) analyses we tested for changes in GSI accuracy between the current GSI panel (414 SNPs) and the improved panel that includes the GSI panel and the 200 differentiated SNPs (614 SNPs). The addition of the 200 SNPs resulted in much improved assignments (Fig.3 and 4). When we tested the current GSI panel, assignments to the SOG had low true positive rates, indicating low assignment probabilities or misassignments, and individuals from each side of the strait showed similar probabilities to be assigned to SOG east or west (Fig.3). In the Fraser, Chilliwack individuals tended to be assigned to the rest of the Fraser, resulting in high false positive rate when the Fraser was the target reporting unit, and low true positive rates when the Chilliwack  was the target reporting unit (Fig.3). In contrast, when we used the improved panel, all analyses showed low false discovery rate (FDR < 0.05) and high true discovery rate, hitting the target accuracy threshold of 80% of individuals assigned with 80% probability assignment, except for Chilliwack, which showed great improvement but fell slightly short on the true positive rate (70-75% instead of > 80%, Fig.4) . True positive rate of assignment to Chilliwack is likely to increase with greater sample sizes, which are generally targeted for the construction of the reference baseline. Overall, by adding 200 highly differentiated SNPs, true positive rate increased by 48% on average at a 80% of assignment probability threshold in the four target areas, with the greatest increases in Chilliwack (66%) and SOG west (63%), followed by SOG east (49%; Figs.3 and 4). The Fraser had the lowest increase in true positive rate as it was already high in the original GSI panel, even though its false discovery rate was the highest (10%) due to Chilliwack individuals tending to assign to the Fraser (Figs.3 and 4). Similarly, false discovery rate decreased by 5% and accuracy increased by 10% on average.

Finally, with funding from PSSI we expanded our whole genome dataset to include one collection from each designated Conservation Unit (CU) in BC and additional collections from Alaska, for a total of 512 individuals from 44 collections/CUs from Washington to Alaska. This dataset will be used to further characterize population structure across the BC range and beyond, investigate signatures of local adaptation and the environmental factors driving it, assess variation in genomic vulnerability to climate change across the NE Pacific range, estimate genetic diversity, reconstruct past changes in effective population size, and potentially further improve the GSI panel to increase geographic resolution of GSI.","Coastwide Salmon Genetics, Fairbanks, Alaska, May 2025

Chum Salmon CNN predictive age models for the most common age classes have been very successful, attaining precision rates up to 94% (Ames et al. submitted CJFAS 2025).  Fourier Transform-Near Infrared (FT-NIR) spectroscopy and Otolith Shape Analysis (OSA) have provided acceptable age predictions for Rougheye/Blackspotted (REBS complex), Yelloweye and Pacific Ocean Perch rockfish and have demonstrated excellent results for the REBS complex speciation and Yelloweye stock ID. 

The steadily increasing demand for age data regularly exceeds program capacity, and with the SCL experiencing reductions in funding and skilled personnel, traditional age estimation has become a bottleneck in providing age data for the management of Pacific salmon. Automation of the age assignment process for salmon and rockfish species will facilitate increased capacity and supplement existing personnel providing key model age data to ensure fisheries are sustainably managed.","The SCL program provides approximately 120,000 quality controlled age-estimates for salmon and groundfish species annually. Age data are inputs in calculating rates of reproductivity, growth and mortality, critical components in stock productivity and are key parameters in stock assessment analyses. Provision of timely age data estimates enables downstream modelling of stocks performance and allow for these information to be available for consultation processes which are pivotal for sustainable fisheries management, conservation strategies and ecological research. The steadily increasing demand for age data regularly exceeds program capacity forcing requests to be aged on a prioritized basis, with the SCL experiencing reductions in funding and skilled personnel, traditional age estimation has become a bottleneck in providing age data for the management of Pacific salmon and groundfish (Malde et al. 2020). 

Traditional techniques, such as scale and otolith age assignment are labour intensive, time consuming, and prone to inter-reader variability. Improved and accelerated age estimates through the deployment of an AI-driven pipeline of CNN and DML predictive age modeling will augment traditional ageing techniques and transform fish age estimation (Moen et al. 2023; Vabø et al. 2021).

A multiple agency effort (DFO, Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission (PSMFC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G) and the Northern Southeast Regional Aquaculture Association (NSRAA)) have developed working models to successfully predict Chum ages with an AI algorithm trained on 15,000 scale images. Although the existing models are coastwide (Alaska, BC and Washington), our research team is currently supplementing BC images to increase the robustness of the coastwide models while developing new models specific to Chum salmon captured in waters local to BC. 

This is the first step in providing a multi-species Alternative Age Estimation pipeline designed to augment age assignment output capacity within the SCL.","For any AI predictive age model to function it requires input data or attributes, these are typically species and structure dependent. The SCL has focused on the attributes extracted from scales and otoliths for its investigations into predictive age assignment (Table 1).

In the case of salmon, specifically Chum the scale growth pattern is the attribute and a scale image is the means of interpretation (LaLanne and Safsten 1969; McNicol and MacLellan 2010). Chum salmon scales were collected by four agencies: NOAA, ADF&G, NSRAA and DFO. All groups prepare scales similarly for age estimation; scales are mounted to a gum card and acetate impressions are made. An automated high-speed Leica Emspira 3 mobile base camera system was used to selectively and rapidly image impressions of DFO Chum scales. CNN models were developed using 15,754 scale images; 24% of the total collection.  Data were split into training (70%, n=11,012), validation (15%, n=2,365), and testing (15%, n=2,377) and randomly but stratified by age classes to ensure consistent age class distributions across each set. We deployed an ensemble of three CNN models architectures with a proven track record in their application for image classification and regression problems. The ensemble model of EfficientNetV2L, NASNetLarge, and ConvNeXtLarge  provided excellent age predictions for the most common age classes of Chum recruiting to the fishery (Figure 1) (Ames, et al., In press).

In the case of groundfish, the otolith is the structure employed and its weight, shape morphometrics and Infrared spectral scan are the attributes. Together, the otolith morphometric attributes (weight, dimensional measurements, and shape outlines) and FT-NIR spectroscopic data (Benson et al. 2023) were used in machine learning algorithms in R to create predictive statistical models for species classification, stock delineation, and the automated age estimation of select rockfish species. Specifically, age estimation models of Rougheye, Yelloweye and Pacific Ocean perch provided estimates that met the lower acceptable precision rates set by quality control parameters for human generated precisions (Figure 2). Previously aged samples from the SCL Structure Library will be sourced, attribute data will be collected and incorporated into current models to increased the robustness of age predictions of these rockfish species. 

The Alternative Age Estimation program has made great advancements in predictive age modeling based on key attributes of otoliths and scales with plans to apply these models to the most commonly aged species at the SCL.","Traditional age estimation methods rely on highly specialized skills developed through long-term mentorship, these methods are time-intensive and resource-heavy, limiting scalability and throughput. The steadily increasing demand for age data regularly exceeds program capacity forcing requests to be aged on a prioritized basis. While a significant amount of expertise is required to produce fish age estimates this is something AI can be trained to do. This modernization and the work to date establishes the groundwork for an AI-driven pipeline that augments traditional age estimation techniques, dramatically increasing efficiency while maintaining scientific rigor. Accurate and precise age estimation is pivotal for sustainable fisheries management, conservation strategies and ecological research.

Increased capacity benefits age-structured stock assessments that facilitate judicious fisheries resource management decisions commonly via science advice generated in CSAS processes which depend on high quality and consistent age-data. Commercial Fisheries programs are managed in partnership with stakeholders relying on scientific assessments and are dependent on consultative processes to develop and review policies, procedures and regulation.

The implementation of AI pipelines are designed to augment age output and not meant to replace age readers. SCL institutional ageing knowledge acquired over 40 years of ageing experience must be maintained to ensure predictive age assignments remain precise and do not drift as a result of environmental pressures such as climate change.","Model training, testing and validation will continue with previously aged samples in order to increase samples robustness of the three aforementioned rockfish species and Chum. New species (Chinook, Quillback Redbandded and Widow rockfish) are currently in the process of scale imaging, and otolith weighing, imaging and IR scanning. The overall goal is to create a image, weight and IR libraries of all species aged within the SCL age catalog. Model training, testing and validation will proceed on all species when enough structure attributes have been attained. This is the metadata foundation that will support age predictive AI age modeling.

Climate change, in the form of increasing water temperatures will diversely affect salmonid species causing variations in the physiological traits of growth and metabolic condition. Consequentially, driving a divergence from historical growth patterns causing interpretational difficulties that can result in the “smearing” of age classes. The creation of image based libraries has a two fold advantage; (1) it allows for automated predictive age assignments, and (2) it provides the ability to monitor changing growth rates by the direct measure of scale annuli. Measures of growth can provide information encompassing external environmental conditions as indicators of habitat quality, and internal physiological status of health, stress and reproductive state. The development of automated measures of annular growth are currently under investigation.  As climate change becomes more prevalent the SCL expects that age requests will increase to compensate for the dynamic shifts in the ecosystem.

Current plans for operationalization of real-time age prediction of Chum salmon are underway. This will rely on a Frame Work laptop that is specifically design to run the Chum age predictive models and the SCL’s high speed automated scale imaging camera. The series of events are as such; 

scale images will be auto captured from the high speed camera,

an R-script will create image file names of species and specimen ID,

all other attribute metadata such as measure of scale growth will be extracted,

scale age will be predicted, recorded, and exported to the Mark and Recovery database.","Table 1. Represents the total number of structure attributes collected by species.

We found that survival is low during the downstream migration of sub-yearling Chinook in the spring and early summer. Disturbed rearing habitat, high water temperatures, and predation pressure from smallmouth bass were identified as the main threats to Okanagan Chinook juvenile survival. This new knowledge will help us target recovery efforts for this endangered population.","The Canadian Okanagan Chinook population is currently the only Columbia River basin Chinook population in Canada. Chinook escapements to the Okanagan River have been extremely low (less than 100 spawners annually) and many habitat challenges are preventing the recovery of the population. Okanagan Chinook were assessed as Endangered by COSEWIC in 2017, and the population is under review for listing under the Species at Risk Act. Some knowledge gaps that originated from those assessments were uncertainty around juvenile survival and factors influencing it. 

To answer this knowledge gap, we partnered with Thompson Rivers University to support two graduate students to study factors influencing the survival of juvenile Chinook Salmon in the Okanagan River and Lake system. The project was also developed and implemented in collaboration with the Okanagan Nation Alliance’s fisheries biologist Elinor McGrath.","Habitat use and survival:

Subyearling Chinook (n=547) raised in the kł cp̓əlk̓ stim̓ hatchery were implanted with ATS SS400 injectable acoustic transmitters. They were released in two groups, with group A (n=273) released in the Okanagan River below Vertical Drop Structure (VDS) 17 and above Vaseux Lake, and group B (n=274) released downstream of Vaseux lake below McIntyre Dam. A network of 15 ATS SR3001 autonomous receivers was deployed from Okanagan Falls to Osoyoos Lake between 21 May and 8 August, 2024). Receivers were clustered into 7 detection sites, placed to form acoustic “gates” at lake inlets and outlets, narrows and channel constrictions, and potential rearing/migration corridors. An ATS SR3017 mobile receiver with hydrophone was used to survey shallow side channels, deeper offshore areas beyond stationary coverage, and upstream and downstream of VDS structures. The proportion of fish detected decreased sharply for both release groups as fish migrated downstream, which translated to low survival in both release groups. Tag burden was not deemed a source of direct mortality, but could have increased susceptibility to predation. 

Smallmouth bass diet and predation:

Targeted angling was conducted in the Okanagan River, Vaseux Lake, Osoyoos Lake from May 3 to August 7, 2024. The dominant species captured were smallmouth bass, which comprised 76% of the total catch (n=196), followed by Northern Pikeminnow (16%, n=41) and Yellow Perch (4%, n=11). There was a spatial shift in the distribution of smallmouth bass caught during the study. In May, less than half (45%) of smallmouth bass were caught at Vertical Drop Structures (VDS), but the proportion of smallmouth bass captured at VDS structures increased to 100% and 80% in June and July, respectively. Bass were observed utilizing rocky substrate and rip rap below the VDS structures to ambush prey. Diet content visual analysis was performed on a subsample of 73 of the total 196 smallmouth bass. A total of 162 fish stomach samples were sent for DNA barcode sequencing. Chinook salmon was only detected once in the DNA samples, but direct evidence of bass predation on juvenile Chinook was obtained by recovery of an acoustic tag used in the juvenile migration and habitat use study. DNA metabarcoding identified a diverse assemblage of 146 unique prey taxa. Aquatic insects (Diptera,  Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera), invasive fish (smallmouth bass, yellow perch, common carp), and native fish (prickly sculpin, mountain whitefish, sockeye/kokanee, chinook) were the most common prey items in smallmouth bass stomach contents.","The research conducted through this project added greatly to the limited knowledge of juvenile Chinook survival in the Okanagan River and Lake system. 

The acoustic telemetry study revealed that juvenile Chinook survival is low during their spring outmigration in the Okanagan River. It identified critical freshwater mortality hotspots in Vaseux Lake, in the Okanagan River, and in the northern portion of Osoyoos Lake. This mortality was associated with warm water temperatures and habitat constraints, and provides evidence for supporting habitat restoration strategies to increase juvenile survival. Proposed actions include:

Reconnecting side channels

Re-naturalizing riparian zones

Adding deep pools, woody debris, and cover

Managing macrophyte growth

Adjusting dam operations for cold water inflow protection

Adapting hatchery release strategy (timing and location) to maximize juvenile survival

The predation study revealed that predation pressure by native and invasive fish species, especially by smallmouth bass, is likely high and contributes to the low survival of juvenile Chinook in the Okanagan River and Lake system. It also identified predation hotspots at Vertical Drop Structure (VDS) sites on the Okanagan River. Proposed actions to mitigate the impacts of smallmouth bass predation include:

Reduce predation hotspots at VDS sites with restoration efforts to remove or modify existing structures

Targeted smallmouth bass removal in the Okanagan River and Lake system with electrofishing or angling programs

Protect and enhance rearing habitat for juvenile Chinook by supporting the habitat restoration strategies listed above","The findings from this project should be considered in the rebuilding and conservation plan of this endangered conservation unit, as it identified specific and tangible actions that have the potential to increase juvenile Chinook survival, productivity, and abundance of the CU. 

Remaining knowledge gaps and recommendations for future studies include:

Using predator-detecting acoustic tags to determine juvenile mortality from predation and finer-scale movement data to elucidate habitat use throughout the migration corridor

Estimating the smallmouth bass population size in the Okanagan River and Lake system to quantify the predation pressure on juvenile Chinook 

Understanding the role of predation from other native and invasive piscivorous fish and avian predators on juvenile Chinook survival","Figure 1: Proportion of acoustic tagged juvenile Chinook detected at downstream detections sites and resulting survival curves for release Group A (n= 273 upstream of Vaseux Lake) and B (n=274 downstream of McIntyre Dam). In both release groups, there is a sharp decline in the proportion of fish detected and survival is low during the downstream migration. 

Figure 2: DNA metabarcoding stomach content analysis of n=162 smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) captured at various locations in the Okanagan River and Lake system. Aquatic insects (Diptera,  Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera), invasive fish (smallmouth bass, yellow perch, common carp), and native fish (prickly sculpin, mountain whitefish, Sockeye/kokanee, Chinook) were the most common prey items identified.

The intended outcomes for the workshop are for participants to understand the scope and capabilities of salmonMSE, have working knowledge of how to apply salmonMSE to simple examples that include integrated hatcheries, and understand how these can be expanded to include complexities in life-history diversity, environmental drivers, and harvest and hatchery management strategies.

SalmonMSE is currently being applied to Upper Strait of Georgia Chinook salmon to inform the evaluation of harvest and hatchery management options for an upcoming FSAR process (planned for Nov 2026). We recommend the application of salmonMSE to inform fisheries stock advice for Pacific salmon more broadly, especially when harvest and hatchery levers are considered and conservation, harvest, and PNI objectives are identified. We further recommend exploring salmonMSE for SEP production planning, e.g., for evaluating alternative release strategies and broodtake rules.

Gaps remain in our ability to include environmental drivers and impacts of habitat restoration into salmonMSE. There are opportunities to combine salmonMSE with inferences from other habitat models or limiting factors frameworks, such as CEMPRA (Cumulative Effects Model for Prioritizing Research Activities) and RAMS (Risk Assessment Methods for Salmon), and causal modelling (e.g., using DSEM, Dynamic Structural Equation Models). Doing so would allow us to more clearly and transparently identify and document risks created by environmental or ecosystem conditions for achieving management objectives, and the relative benefits of more specific restoration efforts to mitigate those impacts.","salmonMSE R package: Huynh Q (2025). salmonMSE: Management Strategy Evaluation for Salmon.
