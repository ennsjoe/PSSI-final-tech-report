  abstract = {Juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) of the Sacramento River system encounter many anthropogenically-induced stressors while rearing and migrating to the Pacific Ocean. Located in a prominent agricultural region, the watershed serves as a source of notable contaminants including pesticides. Salmon rearing in riverine and floodplain areas are potentially exposed to these compounds via dietary exposure, which can vary based on selected food webs. Previous studies have suggested that juvenile Chinook salmon rearing in riverine and floodplain environments of the Sacramento River watershed are characterized by different dietary preferences, with potential for contrasting pesticide exposure between habitats. To examine the potential for pesticide exposure, juvenile Chinook salmon and known dietary items were collected in the mainstem Sacramento River and an adjacent floodplain, the Yolo Bypass, in 2019 and 2020, and analyzed for 33 pesticides, including degradates and isomers. Organochlorine pesticides including the DDX group (p,p’-DDT, p,p’-DDD and p,p’-DDE) were prevalent in all examined biota. There was a significantly greater number of total pesticide detections across all classes in zooplankton compared to macroinvertebrates, coupled with higher bifenthrin concentrations in zooplankton across regions and years, which may indicate different exposure potential depending on fish dietary preferences. Detection frequencies and concentrations of organochlorines were higher in prey items during flooding than in drought conditions, suggesting resuspension of legacy compounds. Significantly higher concentrations of organochlorines were recorded in floodplain rearing fish compared to the Sacramento River. These findings suggest that within these habitats, juvenile Chinook salmon feeding primarily on zooplankton within the water column may be exposed to a greater range of pesticides than those feeding on benthic macroinvertebrates, and that the benefits of floodplain rearing may come at a cost of increased organochlorine exposure.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Many wildlife populations are declining at rates higher than can be explained by known threats to biodiversity. Recently, thiamine (vitamin B               1               ) deficiency has emerged as a possible contributing cause. Here, thiamine status was systematically investigated in three animal classes: bivalves, ray-finned fishes, and birds. Thiamine diphosphate is required as a cofactor in at least five life-sustaining enzymes that are required for basic cellular metabolism. Analysis of different phosphorylated forms of thiamine, as well as of activities and amount of holoenzyme and apoenzyme forms of thiamine-dependent enzymes, revealed episodically occurring thiamine deficiency in all three animal classes. These biochemical effects were also linked to secondary effects on growth, condition, liver size, blood chemistry and composition, histopathology, swimming behaviour and endurance, parasite infestation, and reproduction. It is unlikely that the thiamine deficiency is caused by impaired phosphorylation within the cells. Rather, the results point towards insufficient amounts of thiamine in the food. By investigating a large geographic area, by extending the focus from lethal to sublethal thiamine deficiency, and by linking biochemical alterations to secondary effects, we demonstrate that the problem of thiamine deficiency is considerably more widespread and severe than previously reported.},

We used a spatio-temporal bioenergetics model of the Northeast Pacific Ocean to quantify how predation by three species of pinnipeds and killer whales (               Orcinus orca               ) on Chinook salmon (               Oncorhynchus tshawytscha               ) has changed since the 1970s along the west coast of North America, and compare these estimates to salmon fisheries. We find that from 1975 to 2015, biomass of Chinook salmon consumed by pinnipeds and killer whales increased from 6,100 to 15,200 metric tons (from 5 to 31.5 million individual salmon). Though there is variation across the regions in our model, overall, killer whales consume the largest biomass of Chinook salmon, but harbor seals (               Phoca vitulina               ) consume the largest number of individuals. The decrease in adult Chinook salmon harvest from 1975–2015 was 16,400 to 9,600 metric tons. Thus, Chinook salmon removals (harvest\,+\,consumption) increased in the past 40 years despite catch reductions by fisheries, due to consumption by recovering pinnipeds and endangered killer whales. Long-term management strategies for Chinook salmon will need to consider potential conflicts between rebounding predators or endangered predators and prey.},

The recovery of many marine mammal populations on the west coast of the United States has been viewed as a success; however, within Puget Sound in Washington State, the increased abundance of three protected pinniped species may be adversely affecting the recovery of threatened Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and endangered killer whales (Orcinus orca) within the region. Between 1970 and 2015, we estimate that the annual biomass of Chinook salmon consumed by pinnipeds has increased from 68 to 625 metric tons. Converting juvenile Chinook salmon into adult equivalents, we found that by 2015, pinnipeds consumed double that of resident killer whales and six times greater than the combined commercial and recreational catches. We demonstrate the importance of interspecific interactions when evaluating species recovery. As more protected species respond positively to recovery efforts, managers should attempt to evaluate tradeoffs between these recovery efforts and the unintended ecosystem consequences of predation and competition on other protected species.},

  abstract = {Several studies in the North Pacific Ocean have documented the consequences of rising sea surface temperatures and the advancement of the spring freshet on ocean productivity. The altering of ocean productivity has also been correlated with changes in the marine survival and geographic occurrence of some Pacific salmon populations. Knowledge of the marine survival and position of salmon in the Pacific Ocean are derived typically from mark-recapture studies. As a result, the migratory behaviour and associated survival estimates of salmon in real time are not known. Major information gaps also exist in terms of stock-specific marine behaviour and survival—especially as they relate to recent changes in climate. Acoustic telemetry and other modern tools enable researchers to answer specific questions about environmental, physiological, and genetic effects on individual salmon survival and behaviour, which had not been possible previously. As climate trends increasingly exceed those found in historical records, there is an urgent need for information that will improve fishery management and conservation decisions. International, multidisciplinary research teams using modern technologies could accomplish this.},

  abstract = {Understanding the evolutionary responses of anadromous salmon and trout to climate change is critical for effective conservation planning. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive review of literature published from 2010 to 2020 to synthesize current knowledge on climate impacts to these fish populations. Specifically, we focused on 199 papers that explored evolutionary processes in response to changing environmental conditions. Our analysis revealed several key themes, including the interwoven influences of climate and human activities on genetic variation, phenotypic traits, and population dynamics. We found that geographic patterns in genetic diversity are closely linked to climatic gradients, highlighting the importance to conservation strategies of variation in existing adaptive capacity. Additionally, temporal trends in phenology, maturation age, and fecundity indicate ongoing evolutionary and plastic responses to climate change. Importantly, human activities were identified as significant drivers of maladaptation in anadromous salmon and trout populations. We emphasize the need for targeted monitoring of specific evolutionary processes to mitigate the loss of genetic diversity and enhance adaptive capacity. Our study underscores the importance of identifying and protecting areas of high genetic diversity and rare genes, particularly in regions projected to experience rapid climatic shifts. In conclusion, our findings identify strengths and gaps in the research investigating the role of evolutionary dynamics in the face of climate change. By capitalizing on new tools for sequencing, genomic analysis, and automated field data collection, we can establish baselines for tracking evolutionary responses to climate change. Better integration of evolutionary processes into projections of future climate impacts will lead to more effective strategies to ensure the long-term resilience of these iconic fish species and other wildlife.},

The ultimate goal is to provide a tool to assist in informing decisions on the siting and management of fish farms and to further understanding of the regional coastal oceanography. The complicated coastline and bathymetry are approximated with an unstructured triangular grid in the horizontal direction and terrain-following coordinates in the vertical. The period of 1 March to 31 July 2016, is simulated using the Finite Volume Community Ocean Model and results are evaluated through comparisons with a combination of acoustic Doppler current profiler, tide gauge, and temperature and salinity observations. The model was found to be accurate in representing (i) tidal elevations and currents everywhere throughout the model domain and (ii) subtidal currents and temperature and salinity along the shelf. However, it fared poorly in inlets where (i) the tidal currents were relatively weak and not the dominant source of mixing and/or (ii) steep bathymetry necessitated smoothing. Sources of these and other inaccuracies, and the changes needed to overcome them, are discussed. Overall, this work highlights the complex and diverse dynamics at play in a glacially-carved coastal ocean, providing an extensive discussion of modelling challenges and potential solutions.},

We used stable isotopes of organic carbon and nitrogen measured in 21 sediment cores to determine the contributions and fluxes of marine-derived and terrigenous organic matter over time. The flux of marine-derived organic matter shows no trend for at least the last 100 years. An apparent increase in the marine flux in recent years is due to remineralization of organic matter as it passes through surface sediments. In contrast, the flux of terrigenous organic matter has increased over the last century in the Strait of Georgia, while in Puget Sound, terrigenous flux peaked in the mid-20th century. Total primary production has neither increased nor decreased in the Salish Sea over the last century. Consequently, a decline in primary production cannot explain recent declines in fish populations.},

Juveniles are exposed to a suite of contaminants during outmigration including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes. We collected natural origin subyearling Chinook salmon from sites in and around the industrial harbor to evaluate growth (otolith microstructural analysis) in relation to measured chemical concentrations in tissue. A reduced growth rate was associated with higher tissue contaminant concentrations, particularly mixtures represented by PAHs and certain PCBs, which were elevated in juvenile Chinook collected throughout sites within Portland Harbor relative to those captured upstream. First-year growth is an established predictor of individual survival and eventual reproductive success in Chinook salmon. Therefore, our results indicate that legacy pollution may be limiting the population abundance of threatened Willamette River Chinook salmon, and future habitat remediation or restoration actions may benefit ongoing species recovery efforts.},

  abstract = {Chemical pollution can degrade aquatic ecosystems. Chinook salmon in contaminated habitats are vulnerable to health impacts from toxic exposures. Few studies have been conducted on adverse health outcomes associated with current levels and mixtures of contaminants. Fewer still address effects specific to the juvenile life-stage of salmonids. The present study evaluated contaminant-related effects from dietary exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations and mixture profiles in juvenile Chinook salmon from industrialized waterways in the U.S. Pacific Northwest using two end points: growth assessment and disease susceptibility. The dose and chemical proportions were reconstituted based on environmental sampling and analysis using the stomach contents of juvenile Chinook salmon recently collected from contaminated, industrialized waterways. Groups of fish were fed a mixture with fixed proportions of 10 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), 3 dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs), and 13 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at five concentrations for 35 days. These contaminant compounds were selected because of elevated concentrations and the widespread presence in sediments throughout industrialized waterways. Fork length and otolith microstructural growth indicators were significantly reduced in fish fed environmentally relevant concentrations of these contaminants. In addition, contaminant-exposed Chinook salmon were more susceptible to disease during controlled challenges with the pathogen Aeromonas salmonicida. Our results indicate that dietary exposure to contaminants impairs growth and immune function in juvenile Chinook salmon, thereby highlighting that current environmental exposure to chemicals of potential management concern threatens the viability of exposed salmon.},

  abstract = {We have compiled and archived a large fraction of the zooplankton data collected from the Strait of Georgia during the past 50 years. Although the full dataset is very heterogeneous and gappy, sampling since 1990 has been consistent and frequent enough to examine interannual variability of the full zooplankton community. In this paper we focus on deep tows at mid-Strait deep-water locations, where verticalmigratory zooplankton can be captured at all times of day and all seasons. Average zooplankton dryweight biomass is high ( 9 g m 2) and varies seasonally between a winter minimum ( 4 g m 2) and a broad late-spring to autumn maximum (10–11 g m 2). Much of the biomass in all seasons consists of large crustaceans (copepods, euphausiids and amphipods with oceanic and subarctic zoogeographic affinities) that undergo strong diurnal or seasonal vertical migrations. Their interannual variability is very strong: about an order of magnitude within most zooplankton categories, and nearly two orders of magnitude for euphausiids, large copepods, and chaetognaths. Most (73\%) of the interannual variability is accounted for by three principal components. The dominant mode (36\%) is a low-frequency decadal fluctuation shared by most zooplankton taxa: declining from 1990 to 1995, increasing to a maximum 1999–2002, declining to a second minimum in 2005–2007, and then recovering to near-average levels by 2010. This zooplankton signal correlates positively with the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) climate index, negatively with temperature anomalies throughout the water column, and positively (but less consistently) with survival anomalies of Strait of Georgia salmon and herring. Proximal causal mechanisms are less certain, but probably include estuarine advective exchange with outer coast populations, and timing match–mismatch within the Strait.},

  abstract = {Introduction               Understanding how abundance, productivity and distribution of individual species may respond to climate change is a critical first step towards anticipating alterations in marine ecosystem structure and function, as well as developing strategies to adapt to the full range of potential changes.                                         Methods               This study applies the NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) Fisheries Climate Vulnerability Assessment method to 64 federally-managed species in the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem to assess their vulnerability to climate change, where vulnerability is a function of a species’ exposure to environmental change and its biological sensitivity to a set of environmental conditions, which includes components of its resiliency and adaptive capacity to respond to these new conditions.                                         Results               Overall, two-thirds of the species were judged to have Moderate or greater vulnerability to climate change, and only one species was anticipated to have a positive response. Species classified as Highly or Very Highly vulnerable share one or more characteristics including: 1) having complex life histories that utilize a wide range of freshwater and marine habitats; 2) having habitat specialization, particularly for areas that are likely to experience increased hypoxia; 3) having long lifespans and low population growth rates; and/or 4) being of high commercial value combined with impacts from non-climate stressors such as anthropogenic habitat degradation. Species with Low or Moderate vulnerability are either habitat generalists, occupy deep-water habitats or are highly mobile and likely to shift their ranges.                                         Discussion               As climate-related changes intensify, this work provides key information for both scientists and managers as they address the long-term sustainability of fisheries in the region. This information can inform near-term advice for prioritizing species-level data collection and research on climate impacts, help managers to determine when and where a precautionary approach might be warranted, in harvest or other management decisions, and help identify habitats or life history stages that might be especially effective to protect or restore.},

The hypothesis tested here is that juvenile Chinook from Puget Sound (Washington, USA) area hatcheries exhibit differential survival as categorized by the state of contamination in their respective natal estuaries. Data were examined from 20 hatcheries that released fish to 14 local estuaries in the Greater Puget Sound area over 37 years (1972–2008). A parallel analysis was also conducted for coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) outmigrating from many of the same hatcheries. For all years combined, juvenile Chinook transiting contaminated estuaries exhibited an overall rate of survival that was 45\% lower than that for Chinook moving through uncontaminated estuaries, which was confirmed when tested year by year. The results for coho originating from the same hatcheries and sharing a similar marine distribution indicated no substantial differences among estuaries. These observations have important implications for wild juvenile Chinook that spend more time in the estuary compared with hatchery-reared fish.},

  abstract = {Interannual dynamics of feeding conditions for nekton in the upper epipelagic layer of the western Bering Sea is considered for the summer and fall seasons of 2002–2020. In the summers, daily consumption by fish and squids ranged from 0.01 to 0.10 t/km2 in the deepwater basins and between 0.01–0.38 t/km2 in the shelf area at Cape Navarin. In the falls, the consumption increased to 0.03–0.14 t/km2 in the deep-water basins, and to 0.01–0.53 t/km2 in the Navarin area. Summary in the summer-fall periods, the fish and squids consumed 2–5 \% of zooplankton production (up to 5–7 \% in some years) in the deep-sea basins that is rather low degree of the zooplankton resources usage. In the Navarin area, the consumption is considerably higher and is estimated as 5 \% in summer and 21 \% in fall season, on average. In cases of heightened nekton biomass and reduced zooplankton biomass in some years, the grazing pressure on plankton increased, in particular on euphausiids, hyperiids and pteropods, while the intensity of salmon feeding decreased, with extension the portions of nektonic food and other zooplankton groups, as arrowworms, in their diet. On the other hand, the portion of juvenile fish and squids in the salmon diet increased in cases of high abundance of this prey, too. Weak correlation was detected both between the salmon feeding and abundance of their prey and between the salmon feeding and abundance of salmons. The feeding conditions for pink salmon during their offshore migration did not determine the rate of their returns. Strong year-classes of pink salmon had large returns in conditions of either poor or rich food supply in fall season, so the feeding in fall was not important for the pink salmon survival in the ocean in winter. Feeding of other fish and squids species did not change noticeably in the years with reduced food supply. In general, abundance and species composition of plankton and nekton communities were rather stable in the western Bering Sea in the 2000-2010s, and this current state of the ecosystem provides stable functioning of nekton communities both in the deepwater and Navarin areas.},

The goal of this study was to improve our understanding of how marine mammal predation may be impacting the survival and productivity of Coho Salmon in the Strait of Georgia, British Columbia. Specifically, we quantified the impact of harbor seal Phoca vitulina predation on juvenile Coho Salmon during their first several months at sea. Early marine survival is believed to be the limiting factor for the recovery of Coho Salmon populations in this region. Methods: To estimate the number of juvenile Coho Salmon consumed by harbor seals, we developed a mathematical model that integrates predator diet data and salmon population and mortality dynamics. Result: Our analysis estimated that harbor seals consumed an annual average of 46−59\% of juvenile Coho Salmon between 2004–2016, providing the first quantitative estimate of seal predation in the Strait of Georgia. Conclusion: Marine mammal predation on juvenile Coho Salmon is potentially a very important factor limiting survival and recovery of Coho Salmon in the Strait of Georgia.},

  abstract = {We present a coupled three‐dimensional biological‐physical model for the Salish Sea and evaluate it by comparison to nitrate, silicate, and chlorophyll observations. It accurately reproduces nitrate concentrations with Willmott skill scores, root‐mean‐square error, and bias ranging from 0.84–0.95, 4.02–6.5 μM, and −2.33–1.84 μM, respectively, compared to three independent discrete sample data sets. A prominent feature of the model output is a tidal jet emanating from Discovery Passage producing a downstream plume of elevated surface nitrate. The signal is present from April to September, when surface nitrate is otherwise drawn down. It has a weak but statistically significant correlation to Discovery Passage tidal velocity (R = 0.37, p {$<$} 0.01). Within the turbulent jet and associated plume, the average rate of vertical nitrate supply due to mixing and advection across a depth of roughly 6 m is 0.46 μmol m−2 s−1 between 15 May and 20 August 2015, compared to 0.10 μmol m−2 s−1 for the northern Strait of Georgia as a whole. Close to Discovery Passage, where velocities and shear are strongest, the majority of the vertical nitrate flux is due to mixing. As velocities weaken downstream, vertical advection becomes more important relative to mixing, but vertical velocities also decrease. The tidal pulses out of Discovery Passage drive waves that contribute net upward nitrate flux as far south as Cape Lazo, 40 km away. The nitrate supply drives new production, consistent with existing observations. Similar dynamics have been described in many other tidally influenced coastal systems. Plain Language Summary A three‐dimensional coupled physical‐biological model has been developed that simulates currents, nutrients, and phytoplankton in the Salish Sea. Comparisons with observations show that the model successfully represents key aspects of the nitrogen cycle in the Strait of Georgia, including the seasonal cycle and regional differences. The model is used to investigate mechanisms through which tidal currents lead to nutrient supply to the surface layer, where phytoplankton have enough light to grow, in the northern Strait of Georgia. Strong tidal flow through the narrow Discovery Passage leads to turbulence that mixes deep nutrients to the surface. Tidal currents then advect the surface nutrient plume further into the Strait of Georgia. Additional mixing and vertical motion also occur downstream, increasing the amount of nutrients supplied to the surface.},

  abstract = {A three-dimensional coupled biophysical model was developed to study the dynamics of the plankton ecosystem in the Strait of Georgia (SoG) estuary. The ocean circulation component is an implementation of the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) and the lower trophic level ecosystem is a ninecompartment Nutrient–Phytoplankton–Zooplankton–Detritus (NPZD) model that includes two types of phytoplankton and of zooplankton. A three year hindcast (2007–2009) is used to examine the mean annual seasonal cycle of the local plankton dynamics. For realistic values of irradiance, wind forcing and fresh water fluxes, the model predicts a seasonal cycle of salinity, nutrients and plankton in reasonable agreement with observations. In particular, the model reproduces the main features of the estuarine circulation, the marked increase in phytoplankton biomass during spring followed by intermittent less intense blooms during summer and fall, as well as the seasonal pattern of zooplankton biomass. Model results show that primary production fluctuates between low values in January and high values in April, with an annual production of 270 ± 33 (gC m 2) in the SoG. Most primary production is fueled by nitrate (f-ratio of about 0.7). Upwelling is the main source of nitrate into the upper layer, while most of the nitrate entering the Strait is exported out by horizontal advection. Physical processes, such as freshwater inflow, wind events, tidal mixing, and horizontal transports are important in maintaining the high spatio-temporal variability of the local phytoplankton biomass and production. Horizontal variability is high during the growing season (March to September). In summer, phytoplankton concentrates near the surface, in the shallow mixed layer, resulting in sporadic nutrient limitation of phytoplankton growth. In the northern portion of the strait, weaker summer winds and tidal currents lead to increased near-surface stratification which restricts nutrient fluxes and limit phytoplankton growth. In the central region, nitrate and light limitation are equally important at limiting phytoplankton growth during the summer whereas, in the tidally mixed regions of the south, primary production is higher in summer than during the spring resulting in higher annual primary production in this region than elsewhere.},

  abstract = {The Strait of Georgia, Canada, has complex interactions among natural and human pressures that confound understanding of changes in this system. We report on the interannual variability in biomass of 12 zooplankton taxonomic groups in the deep (bottom depths greater than 50 m) central and northern Strait of Georgia from 1996 to 2018, and their relationships with 10 physical variables. Total zooplankton biomass was dominated (76\%) by large-sized crustaceans (euphausiids, large and medium size calanoid copepods, amphipods). The annual anomaly of total zooplankton biomass was highest in the late 1990s, lowest in the mid-2000s, and generally above its climatological (1996–2010) average after 2011, although many individual groups had different patterns. Two latent trends (derived from dynamic factor analyses) described the variability of annual biomass anomalies underlying all zooplankton groups: a U-shaped trend with its minimum in the mid-2000s, and a declining trend from 2001 to 2011. Two latent trends also described the physical variables. The variability represented by these four latent trends clustered into two periods: 1996–2006, with generally declining zooplankton biomass and increasing salinities, and 2007–2018, with increasing zooplankton biomass and decreasing salinities. ARIMA modelling showed sea surface salinity at Entrance Island in the middle Strait of Georgia, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and the peak date of the spring phytoplankton bloom were significantly related to the two latent zooplankton trends. ARIMA models comparing zooplankton and physical variables with the marine survivals of four salmon populations which enter the Strait as juveniles (Chinook: Cowichan River, Puntledge River, Harrison River; Coho: Big Qualicum River) all included zooplankton groups consistent with known salmon prey; prominent among the physical variables were sea surface salinity and variables representing the flow from the Fraser River. These regressions explained (               adj               R               2               ) 38 to 85\% of the annual variability in marine survival rates of these salmon populations over the study time period. Although sea temperature was important in some relationships between zooplankton biomass and salmon marine survival, salinity was a more frequent and more important variable, consistent with its influence on the hydrodynamics of the Strait of Georgia system.},

Temperature, salinity, and oxygen data were collected monthly in the upper 50 m at three stations in Herbert Inlet from June 2020 to July 2021, marking the first time series of its kind in a Clayoquot Sound fjord. Hypoxic conditions were shallowest (minimum depth of 12 m) and most intensified in summer; near-surface hypoxia was recorded at one or more stations in all months except in winter. Considering that many local marine species, including wild Pacific salmon, experience adverse effects at oxygen concentrations much higher than the hypoxic threshold, we note that 50 to 100\% of the upper 50 m of Herbert Inlet consistently presented low oxygen concentrations (defined here as a guideline as ≤ 4.9 mL L               -1               or 6.9 mg L               -1               ) during the 14-month study period. Previous observations collected sporadically since May 1959 confirmed the presence of hypoxic conditions in the past. These findings suggest that long-term, multidisciplinary studies are needed to understand and predict the impact of hypoxia and deoxygenation on wild salmon stocks as climate changes.},

Conversely, climate warming appears to be allowing salmon to expand northwards into the Arctic. Between these geographic extremes, in the Gulf of Alaska region, salmon are at historically high abundances but face an uncertain future due to rapid environmental change. We examined changes in climate, hydrology, land cover, salmon populations, and fisheries over the past 30–70 years in this region. We focused on the Kenai River, which supports world-famous fisheries but where Chinook Salmon O. tshawytscha populations have declined, raising concerns about their future resilience. The region is warming and experiencing drier summers and wetter autumns. The landscape is also changing, with melting glaciers, wetland loss, wildfires, and human development. This environmental transformation will likely harm some salmon populations while benefiting others. Lowland salmon streams are especially vulnerable, but retreating glaciers may allow production gains in other streams. Some fishing communities harvest a diverse portfolio of fluctuating resources, whereas others have specialized over time, potentially limiting their resilience. Maintaining diverse habitats and salmon runs may allow ecosystems and fisheries to continue to thrive amidst these changes.},

  abstract = {The Strait of Georgia, Canada, is an important region for numerous commercially and culturally important species (e.g., herring, salmon, and orcas), yet little is known about the links between lower trophic level (e.g. phytoplankton and zooplankton) phenology due to historical sampling gaps. Here, we present fourteen years (2003-2016) of data linking interannual variability in phytoplankton and zooplankton phenology in the Central Strait of Georgia, BC. Satellite-derived chlorophyll               a               (Chl               a               ) data were used to calculate spring bloom dynamics (bloom initiation, bloom intensity, and bloom magnitude). Average spring bloom~initiation occurred during the last week of March in the Central Strait of Georgia. Bloom initiation occurred in mid-to-late February/early March during “early” Chl               a               bloom years (2004, 2005, and 2015) whereas initiation did not occur until the end of April during “late” bloom years (2007, 2008). Spring Chl               a               bloom initiation was significantly correlated with the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO; r = 0.75, p \&lt; 0.01) and spring sea surface temperature (SST; r~= -0.70, p \&lt; 0.01); spring blooms occurred earlier during warm years. When all environmental variables were considered together, NPGO best explained variations in spring bloom initiation (Adj R               2               = 0.53, p \&lt; 0.01) and bloom magnitude (Adj R               2               = 0.57, p \&lt; 0.01), whereas stratification best explained variations in bloom intensity (Adj R               2               = 0.38, p \&lt; 0.05). Early Chl               a               blooms were associated with high crustacean abundance (maximum of \&gt; 1000 ind m               -3               ) but low biomass (37.5 mg m               -3               ). Independent of the Chl               a               data, hierarchical cluster analysis revealed similar groupings of years for crustacean abundance data. Most notably, community composition in cluster Group 2 (2004, 2005, and 2015; early Chl               a               bloom years), was comprised of a higher proportion of small crustaceans (e.g. non-calanoid copepods) compared to the other cluster groups. To our knowledge, this study provides the first evidence linking early spring Chl               a               bloom timing to a shift in the crustacean community towards smaller taxa in response to multiple warm events in the Strait of Georgia. Our results show that early Chl               a               blooms may potentially result in a mismatch between phytoplankton and large energy-rich crustacean zooplankton, with lower abundances of the latter. In contrast, average Chl               a               bloom years were optimal for large-bodied euphausiids, whereas late Chl               a               blooms were a match for some crustaceans (e.g., medium calanoid copepods), but not others (e.g., large calanoid copepods and amphipods). We hypothesize that early bloom years may result in poorer feeding conditions for juvenile salmon and other predators in the region.},

  abstract = {We used a three-dimensional coupled biophysical model to examine zooplankton dynamics in the Salish Sea, NE Pacific. First, we evaluated the two zooplankton classes of the SalishSeaCast model using a transboundary zooplankton dataset comprised of observation data from the Canadian and United States waters of the Salish Sea from 2015 to 2019. Model zooplankton classes correspond to micro- and meso-zooplankton whose biomass is tightly coupled to phytoplankton through modelled food web dynamics (Z1) and mesozooplankton with life cycle-based seasonal grazing impacts (Z2). Overall, the model effectively captured seasonal patterns in observed biomass, although with slightly higher biomass estimates for both Z1 and Z2 (Bias = 0.10 and 0.08 g C m 2, respectively). Model fit varied regionally, with a weaker model fit being observed in nearshore regions. In addition, an autumn peak in Z2 was observed in the model, but not in the observations, suggesting some seasonal variations in model fit. Following the model evaluation, we used the model to determine seasonal and regional patterns of zooplankton grazing. Seasonally, the main peak in modelled zooplankton biomass increased in April or May in most of the regions defined within the Salish Sea and was driven by grazing on diatoms. Regionally, depth-integrated zooplankton biomass was consistently highest in areas adjacent to regions of strong tidal mixing. In addition, model-based zooplankton grazing was highest in the tidally mixed regions where phytoplankton biomass was high due to advection into the region despite low primary productivity. Our model-based results provide an opportunity to examine bottom-up food web processes at spatio-temporal scales not achievable with in situ sampling and help to elucidate key drivers of lower trophic level dynamics within the Salish Sea.},

  abstract = {Interspecific competition can significantly impact marine ecosystems by affecting species distributions and abundances. Understanding how sympatric species utilize available food helps identify potential competition and its effects when resources are limited. Here, we applied a suite of analytical methods (diet analysis, stable isotopes, and biomass estimates) to identify potential competitive interactions among North Pacific pelagic predators. Samples were collected in the Gulf of Alaska during the winter of 2019. Environmental conditions and food web structure (prey consumption, species biomass, and isotopic niche overlap) varied across the region. Several squid and myctophid species occupied similar trophic positions and had high isotopic nice overlap with Pacific salmon. The intensity of these interactions differed between the northwest and southeast Gulf of Alaska. For example, there was a substantial isotopic niche overlap between sockeye salmon and the squid Onychyoteuthis borealijaponica in the southeast, while chum salmon exhibited considerable niche overlap with various species in both areas. Our results demonstrate that, as the biomass of non-salmonid competitors may exceed that of Pacific salmon, these interactions must be considered when assessing salmon production on the high seas. Regional differences in trophic interactions demonstrate that the open ocean northeast Pacific is more dynamic than previously proposed, and knowledge of salmon rearing locations could improve production estimates. Further research on regional ocean properties and their effects on trophic ecology is needed to understand how salmon will respond to climate-driven changes in ocean conditions. This study provides the first analysis of pelagic food webs in the North Pacific high seas during winter, highlighting significant intra-guild competition among meso-predators. The effects of this competition on production are difficult to assess using empirical approaches due to the inaccessibility of the region. We propose the application of the trophic interactions identified here to explore these effects using food web models.},

This assumes that SSLs residing around northern Vancouver Island (British Columbia, Canada) target Sockeye Salmon for just a few weeks during the peak of their run. It is a reasonable enough assumption to warrant immediate priority for field research on SSL behavior and diets during the migration period. We evaluated the plausibility of the assumption with a variety of approaches ranging from simple estimates of maximum SSL consumption to partitioning of observed marine mortality rates and analysis of SSL foraging behavior to show that SSLs could have caused the decline in productivity and abundance of Fraser River Sockeye Salmon.},

  abstract = {Abstract             We collated smolt‐to‐adult return rate (SAR) data for Chinook salmon from all available regions of the Pacific coast of North America to examine the large‐scale patterns of salmon survival. For consistency, our analyses primarily used coded wire tag‐based (CWT) SAR estimates. Survival collapsed over the past half century by roughly a factor of three to ca. 1\% for many regions. Within the Columbia River, the SARs of Snake River populations, often singled out as exemplars of poor survival, are unexceptional and in fact higher than estimates reported from many other regions of the west coast lacking dams. Given the seemingly congruent decline in SARs to similar levels, the notion that contemporary survival is driven primarily by broader oceanic factors rather than local factors should be considered. Ambitious Columbia River rebuilding targets may be unachievable because other regions with nearly pristine freshwater conditions, such as SE Alaska and northern BC, also largely fail to reach these levels. Passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag‐based SAR estimates available for Columbia River Basin populations are generally consistent with CWT findings; however, PIT tag‐based SARs are not adjusted for harvest which compromises their intended use because harvest rates are large and variable. More attention is needed on how SARs should be quantified and how rebuilding targets are defined. We call for a systematic review by funding agencies to assess consistency and comparability of the SAR data generated and to further assess the implications of survival falling to similar levels in most regions of the west coast.},
